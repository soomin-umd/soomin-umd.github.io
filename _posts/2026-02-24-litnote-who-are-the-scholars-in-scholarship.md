# Analysis of "Who are the 'Scholars' in 'Scholarship?': How Higher Education Researchers Represent Positionality in Their Studies"

**Journal of Higher Education | 2026-02-24**

---

## 📌 Core Research Question

How do higher education researchers represent and disclose their own positionality (social identities, backgrounds, and standpoints) within their published scholarship, and what patterns, norms, or gaps exist in these practices across the field? The study likely interrogates whose perspectives are centered or rendered invisible in the production of higher education knowledge, and how researcher identity disclosure (or lack thereof) shapes the research enterprise.

## 🔬 Methodology

Based on the title and publication venue, this is most likely a **systematic content analysis / critical discourse analysis** of published higher education research articles. The methodology would involve:

- **Corpus construction**: Sampling articles from major higher education journals (potentially including *Journal of Higher Education*, *Research in Higher Education*, *Review of Higher Education*, etc.) over a defined time period
- **Coding framework**: Systematic coding for presence/absence and depth of positionality statements, reflexivity practices, identity disclosures (race, class, gender, first-generation status, etc.)
- **Qualitative/mixed-methods analysis**: Potentially combining quantitative descriptive trends with critical qualitative interpretation of how positionality is framed

This is **not a causal inference study** — no DiD, RD, IV, or PSM is employed. Rather, it is a **meta-research / sociology-of-knowledge study** examining the field's epistemological and methodological norms.

## 📊 Key Findings

Without access to the full text (and given the abstract is blank/redacted), specific effect sizes cannot be confirmed. However, based on the title and the field's trajectory, likely findings include:

- Positionality statements remain **inconsistently practiced** across higher education research, with significant variation by methodological tradition (qualitative vs. quantitative)
- Researchers studying marginalized populations may be more likely to disclose positionality, while those in quantitative/policy traditions rarely do
- Certain identities (race, gender) may be disclosed more frequently than others (social class, first-generation status, disability)
- The field may lack consensus on **what constitutes meaningful reflexivity** versus performative disclosure

## 💡 Relevance to My Research

This paper is highly relevant to your work on **intergenerational educational mobility, FGCS, and state financial aid policy** in several ways:

1. **FGCS researcher positionality**: If you are a first-generation scholar yourself (or are not), this paper provides a framework for thinking about how your own background shapes your research questions, interpretations, and policy recommendations regarding FGCS. Disclosing (or critically reflecting on) your proximity to the populations you study is increasingly expected.

2. **Who produces knowledge about FGCS and mobility?**: The paper raises critical questions about whether researchers studying intergenerational mobility and first-generation students share those lived experiences — and how that matters for the knowledge produced. This connects to longstanding debates about **epistemic authority** in studying class-based educational inequalities.

3. **Methodological reflexivity in policy research**: Your work on state financial aid policy likely uses quantitative causal methods (DiD, RD, etc.) where positionality statements are rare. This paper may challenge you to consider how researcher standpoint influences even ostensibly "objective" policy analysis — from variable selection to framing of findings.

4. **Framing your dissertation**: Engaging with this paper can strengthen your methods chapter by articulating your own positionality relative to the communities affected by the policies you study.

## ⭐ Key Quote Worth Citing (verbatim from abstract)

*Unfortunately, the abstract provided is empty/redacted (containing only a `<br />` tag), so a verbatim quote cannot be extracted. I recommend accessing the full text through the Journal of Higher Education to identify key quotable passages, particularly any that address how class-based and first-generation identities are (under)represented in researcher positionality disclosures.*

**Note**: Given the blank abstract, this analysis is necessarily inferential based on the title, journal, and publication context. I recommend reviewing the full article to confirm these interpretations and extract specific empirical findings and quotations for your work.
