# Race Below the Fold: The Absence of Race in the News Media's Coverage of Student Loans

## 📌 Core Research Question

How frequently and in what ways does news media coverage of student loans explicitly address race and racism, and what are the implications of this (non)coverage for how policymakers and the public conceptualize student debt as a policy problem?

## 🔬 Methodology

Based on the title, journal, and abstract excerpt, this study employs **content analysis / discourse analysis** of news media texts related to student loans. This is not a causal identification strategy (no DiD, RD, IV, or PSM) but rather a **qualitative or mixed-methods media analysis** approach. The methodology likely involves:

- **Corpus construction**: Systematic sampling of news articles from major outlets covering student loans over a defined time period
- **Coding framework**: Identification of explicit mentions of race, racial groups, racism, and racial disparities in student debt coverage
- **Discourse/frame analysis**: Examining how the presence or absence of racial language shapes the framing of student loan "problems" and "solutions"
- **Potentially quantitative descriptive analysis**: Frequencies/proportions of race-explicit vs. race-silent coverage

This fits within the tradition of **critical policy discourse analysis** published in EEPA, examining how media framing influences the policy agenda.

## 📊 Key Findings

The abstract strongly signals that the central finding is the **systematic absence or marginalization of race** in news media coverage of student loans — hence "below the fold" (a journalism metaphor for deprioritized content). Specific numbers are not available from the truncated abstract, but likely findings include:

- Race and racism are rarely explicitly mentioned in student loan news coverage
- When race appears, it is likely relegated to secondary or peripheral framing rather than centered as a structural driver of disparate debt burdens
- The dominant media frame likely treats student debt as a **race-neutral, universal problem**, obscuring well-documented racial disparities (e.g., Black borrowers holding disproportionate debt, Black-white wealth gap exacerbating repayment challenges)

## 💡 Relevance to My Research

This paper is highly relevant across all three of your research areas:

- **Intergenerational educational mobility**: The racial student debt gap is deeply intertwined with intergenerational wealth transmission. When media coverage omits race, it obscures how parental wealth (shaped by historical racism) determines who borrows, how much, and repayment capacity — all central mechanisms in intergenerational mobility. Race-silent discourse may perpetuate policies that fail to address structural barriers to upward mobility for Black and Latino families.

- **First-generation college students (FGCS)**: FGCS are disproportionately students of color and disproportionately reliant on loans. If media framing erases race from the student debt narrative, the unique financial vulnerabilities of FGCS of color become invisible in policy discourse. This paper provides a framework for understanding why FGCS-targeted policies may not adequately address racial dimensions of financial need.

- **State financial aid policy**: Media discourse shapes the political environment in which state financial aid policies are designed and debated. If race is systematically absent from public conversation about student loans, state policymakers may design race-neutral aid programs that fail to target resources where racial disparities are most acute. This has direct implications for evaluating whether state aid policies reduce or reproduce racial stratification in educational attainment and debt burden.

This paper also offers a **methodological complement** to your quantitative work — demonstrating how discursive/framing analysis can illuminate the political and cultural contexts that shape the financial aid policies you study.

## ⭐ Key Quote Worth Citing (verbatim from abstract)

> "The media discourse on student loans plays a significant role in the way that policy actors conceptualize challenges and potential solutions related to student debt."

*(Note: The full abstract was truncated; a more specific quote about the absence of race may be available in the complete text and would be a stronger citation candidate.)*
