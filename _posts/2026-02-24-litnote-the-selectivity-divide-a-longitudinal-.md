# Analysis of "The Selectivity Divide: A Longitudinal Study of Religious Pluralism in United States Higher Education"

## 📌 Core Research Question

This study examines how religious pluralism (the diversity of religious identities and traditions represented within campus communities) varies across U.S. higher education institutions over time, with particular attention to how institutional selectivity creates a "divide" in the degree of religious diversity experienced by students. The central question appears to be: How has religious pluralism evolved across different tiers of institutional selectivity in American colleges and universities, and what factors explain divergent trajectories?

## 🔬 Methodology

Based on the title's indication of a "longitudinal study," the research likely employs:

- **Longitudinal/panel data analysis** tracking religious composition at institutions over multiple time points
- Potential use of diversity indices (e.g., Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, Simpson's Diversity Index, or similar pluralism measures) to quantify religious heterogeneity
- Stratification by institutional selectivity tiers to compare trajectories
- Likely descriptive and correlational approaches, possibly supplemented with regression models controlling for institutional characteristics (size, region, public/private status, founding mission)

**Note:** The abstract provided is effectively empty (contains only a `<br />` tag), so the specific identification strategy cannot be confirmed. Given the topic (religious pluralism as a compositional/demographic outcome), this is more likely a descriptive-longitudinal design than a causal inference framework (DiD, RD, IV, or PSM).

## 📊 Key Findings

Without a substantive abstract, specific effect sizes and numerical findings are unavailable. Based on the title, the study likely finds:

- A significant and potentially growing gap in religious pluralism between more selective and less selective institutions
- More selective institutions may exhibit either greater homogeneity (reflecting socioeconomic and cultural sorting) or greater cosmopolitan diversity, depending on the mechanisms at play
- Temporal trends suggesting that institutional selectivity increasingly mediates students' exposure to religious diversity

## 💡 Relevance to My Research

- **Intergenerational educational mobility:** Institutional selectivity is a critical stratifying mechanism. If religious pluralism diverges by selectivity, this reflects broader patterns of cultural and socioeconomic sorting that shape the qualitative experiences of upwardly mobile students. Students moving "up" in selectivity tiers may encounter dramatically different cultural environments than their parents experienced—an underexplored dimension of intergenerational mobility.
- **First-generation college students (FGCS):** FGCS are disproportionately concentrated in less selective institutions. The "selectivity divide" in religious pluralism means FGCS may experience systematically different campus climates regarding diversity and belonging, which intersects with their already complex processes of cultural adjustment and identity negotiation.
- **State financial aid policy:** State aid policies that expand access to more selective institutions (e.g., merit-based scholarships, need-based grants) could indirectly influence the religious and cultural composition of campuses. Understanding how selectivity structures pluralism can inform discussions about what kinds of environments state aid enables students to access.

## ⭐ Key Quote Worth Citing (verbatim from abstract)

**Unable to extract a verbatim quote.** The abstract as provided contains no substantive text (only an HTML line break tag). I recommend accessing the full article through the *Journal of Higher Education* to retrieve citable language. Given the 2026 publication date, this may be a forthcoming or advance-online piece with an incomplete metadata record.

**⚠️ Important caveat:** This analysis is substantially limited by the empty abstract. I have inferred the study's likely content from its title, journal placement, and publication context. I strongly recommend reading the full article before citing or building on this analysis in your own work.
