# Analysis of "We're on Our Own Out Here": Faculty Member Responses to Legislative Threats to Academic Freedom and Scholarship on Race

## 📌 Core Research Question

How do faculty members experience and respond to state-level legislative efforts that restrict or threaten academic freedom, particularly regarding the teaching and scholarship on race (e.g., anti-CRT laws, "divisive concepts" legislation)? The study likely examines the chilling effects of these policies on faculty behavior, curriculum, and scholarly work in higher education.

## 🔬 Methodology

Based on the title and journal context, this is almost certainly a **qualitative study** employing:

- **Semi-structured interviews** with faculty members across institutions in states that have enacted or proposed legislation restricting teaching about race, racism, and related topics
- Likely uses **phenomenological or thematic analysis** to capture lived experiences and behavioral responses
- Possibly draws on a **policy analysis** framework to contextualize faculty responses within the specific legislative environment
- No quantitative identification strategy (DiD, RD, IV, PSM) is indicated — this is an interpretivist/qualitative design

*Note: The abstract was not provided in full, limiting methodological specificity.*

## 📊 Key Findings

Without the full abstract or text, anticipated key findings (consistent with the title's framing) include:

- Faculty report feelings of **isolation and lack of institutional support** ("We're on our own out here" as a central theme)
- Evidence of **self-censorship** in curriculum design, classroom discussion, and research agendas related to race
- Differential impacts on **faculty of color**, who may feel disproportionately targeted or surveilled
- Institutional responses perceived as **inadequate or politically cautious**, leaving faculty to navigate threats individually
- Tension between faculty professional obligations to scholarship and the compliance pressures from state legislation

*(Specific effect sizes not applicable given qualitative design; specific numbers unavailable without full text.)*

## 💡 Relevance to My Research

- **State policy environment shaping higher education access and experience**: Just as state financial aid policy structures opportunity for FGCS and intergenerational mobility, state legislative restrictions on curriculum shape the *quality and content* of education students receive — potentially undermining equity-focused programming that supports FGCS and students of color.
- **Chilling effects on diversity-related support**: If faculty self-censor on race-related topics, this may erode **culturally responsive pedagogy and mentorship** that research shows benefits first-generation and underrepresented students' persistence and success.
- **Intergenerational mobility implications**: Legislation restricting scholarship on race may indirectly affect institutional climates in ways that **disadvantage students whose upward mobility depends on inclusive, equity-minded campus environments** — particularly at public institutions most subject to state control and most likely to serve FGCS.
- **State-level policy variation as a research design opportunity**: This paper's focus on state-level legislative variation could inform your own work on how differential state policy contexts (financial aid *and* academic freedom) jointly shape educational opportunity.

## ⭐ Key Quote Worth Citing (verbatim from abstract)

*The full abstract text was not provided, so a verbatim quote cannot be extracted. However, the title itself is a powerful in-vivo quotation:*

> **"We're on Our Own Out Here"**

*I recommend retrieving the full abstract and article upon publication (March 2026, Journal of Higher Education) to identify specific quotable findings relevant to state policy impacts on faculty and student experience.*

**Recommendation**: When published, this article could serve as a useful counterpoint or complement in your work — illustrating that state higher education policy shapes not only the *financial* dimensions of access (via aid) but also the *intellectual and cultural* environment that supports (or hinders) mobility for first-generation and underrepresented students.
