## 📌 Core Research Question

How do academic outcomes and access to educational opportunity differ for Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NHPI) students when their data are disaggregated from the broader "Asian" or "Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI)" racial category? The study seeks to reveal patterns of educational inequality that are masked by aggregated reporting, centering the experiences of a historically underserved and underrepresented population.

## 🔬 Methodology

The study employs a **QuantCrit (Quantitative Critical Race) framework**, which foregrounds how racial categories in quantitative data are socially constructed and can obscure inequities when aggregated. The authors use **longitudinal administrative data** from a large urban school district in California, tracking NHPI students over time. While the full article is behind an ahead-of-print paywall and specific econometric identification strategies (e.g., DiD, RD, IV) are not detailed in the abstract, the methodological contribution centers on:

- **Data disaggregation** as an analytic and political strategy — separating NHPI students from the broader AAPI category to examine outcome disparities.
- Descriptive and inferential analyses of academic outcomes (likely including GPA, test scores, graduation rates, course access, and/or college readiness indicators).
- Examination of **access to opportunity structures** within the district (e.g., advanced coursework, college-preparatory resources).
- A mixed or complementary approach that combines administrative data analysis with attention to community voice ("amplifying voices"), consistent with QuantCrit's insistence that numbers alone are insufficient without contextual, community-grounded interpretation.

The identification strategy likely relies on **within-district comparisons across racial/ethnic subgroups** using regression-based approaches with controls for socioeconomic and school-level characteristics, rather than a quasi-experimental design per se.

## 📊 Key Findings

The abstract indicates that **NHPI students face significant disparities in academic outcomes** once their data are disaggregated from the AAPI umbrella. Specific effect sizes are not available from the abstract alone, but the core finding is that aggregation with Asian American students — who on average show higher academic performance metrics — **systematically masks the underperformance and underservice of NHPI students**. The study likely documents gaps in achievement, course-taking, and access to college-preparatory opportunities relative to both the aggregated AAPI category and other racial/ethnic groups.

## 💡 Relevance to My Research

This paper connects to your research agenda in several important ways:

1. **Intergenerational educational mobility**: NHPI communities have among the lowest rates of postsecondary attainment in the U.S., meaning K–12 disparities documented here have direct implications for intergenerational mobility. If NHPI students are systematically denied access to college-preparatory opportunities in K–12, the pipeline to higher education — and thus upward mobility — is constricted before students ever reach the postsecondary level.

2. **First-generation college students (FGCS)**: NHPI students are disproportionately likely to be first-generation college-goers. The opportunity gaps documented in this study (e.g., access to advanced coursework) represent the upstream conditions that shape whether FGCS populations even arrive at college doors. Understanding these pre-college disparities enriches your framing of FGCS challenges as structurally produced, not individually determined.

3. **State financial aid policy**: The study's California context is significant. California's state financial aid architecture (Cal Grant, Middle Class Scholarship, CA Dream Act) relies on data systems that may aggregate NHPI students. If policymakers cannot see NHPI students in their data, they cannot design targeted interventions. This paper makes a strong case that **data disaggregation is itself a policy lever** — a methodological argument you could extend to how state aid programs track and serve FGCS from underrepresented racial/ethnic subgroups.

4. **QuantCrit methodology**: If you use large-scale administrative or survey data in your own work, this paper offers a model for critically interrogating racial categories in your datasets and considering whose experiences are rendered invisible by standard classification schemes.
