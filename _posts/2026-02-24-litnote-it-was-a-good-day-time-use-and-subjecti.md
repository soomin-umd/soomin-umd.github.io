# Analysis of "It Was a Good Day? Time Use and Subjective Well-Being Among Lower-Income College Students"

**Journal of Higher Education, 2026**

---

## 📌 Core Research Question

How do lower-income college students allocate their time across daily activities (academics, work, leisure, sleep, socializing, etc.), and how does this time use relate to their subjective well-being (SWB)? The study likely investigates whether the daily lived experiences of economically disadvantaged students — shaped by competing demands on their time — contribute to disparities in well-being and, by extension, academic persistence and success.

## 🔬 Methodology

Without access to the full text (the abstract provided is blank), based on the title and the *Journal of Higher Education*'s methodological norms, this study most likely employs:

- **Time diary / Experience Sampling Method (ESM) or Day Reconstruction Method (DRM):** Students log activities and associated affect across the day, allowing researchers to link specific time-use categories to momentary or daily well-being.
- **Descriptive and regression-based analysis:** OLS or multilevel models (days nested within students) predicting SWB as a function of time allocation across activity categories.
- **Possible identification strategy:** Given the observational nature of time-use data, the study likely uses **within-person variation** (fixed effects at the individual level) to control for unobserved student-level confounders, comparing well-being on days when students spend more vs. less time in particular activities.
- **Sample:** Likely drawn from a specific institution or multi-site sample, with income thresholds (e.g., Pell eligibility) used to define "lower-income."

*Note: The empty abstract limits precise methodological identification. The above is inferred from the title, journal, and conventions of this literature.*

## 📊 Key Findings

Based on the title's framing and the broader literature:

- Lower-income students likely spend more time in paid employment and less time in academically enriching or leisure activities compared to higher-income peers.
- Days characterized by heavy work hours or competing obligations are likely associated with **lower subjective well-being**.
- Time spent in social/relational activities or academically meaningful engagement likely correlates with **higher well-being**.
- There may be a "time poverty" mechanism: constrained time budgets force trade-offs that undermine both well-being and academic integration.

## 💡 Relevance to My Research

This paper is highly relevant across all three of your research pillars:

- **Intergenerational educational mobility:** Time poverty among lower-income students reflects the continued influence of family socioeconomic origin on the college experience. If constrained time use undermines well-being and persistence, it represents a mechanism through which intergenerational disadvantage reproduces itself even after college access is achieved.
- **First-generation college students (FGCS):** FGCS disproportionately come from lower-income backgrounds and are more likely to work extensive hours, commute, and carry family obligations — all of which shape daily time use. This study likely provides evidence on how the *daily texture* of the FGCS experience differs from continuing-generation peers, with implications for belonging, engagement, and completion.
- **State financial aid policy:** If financial constraints force lower-income students into time-use patterns that harm well-being and academic outcomes, this provides a compelling justification for more generous need-based state aid (e.g., sufficient grant aid to reduce work hours). The findings could support arguments that aid policy should target not just tuition affordability but the broader cost of attendance to free up students' time budgets.

## ⭐ Key Quote Worth Citing

*The abstract text was not available in the provided material. I recommend locating the full abstract directly from the Journal of Higher Education (published 2026-02-24) to extract a verbatim quote. A likely citable framing from the paper would connect daily time allocation among lower-income students to measurable well-being disparities — a quote linking financial constraint, time poverty, and affective experience would be particularly powerful for your work on FGCS and state aid policy.*

**Recommendation:** Once you access the full text, pay special attention to (1) whether the authors disaggregate by first-generation status, (2) any policy implications they draw regarding financial aid sufficiency, and (3) the specific well-being measures used, as these could inform your own operationalization of student outcomes beyond GPA and completion.
