# Analysis of "The Impact of Dual Enrollment on College Application Choice and Admission Success"

**Journal of Higher Education**, Volume 97, Issue 1, 2026, pp. 58–89

## 📌 Core Research Question

How does participation in dual enrollment (DE) programs—where high school students take college-level courses for credit—affect the colleges to which students apply and their subsequent admission outcomes? The study likely examines whether DE shifts students toward more selective institutions and whether it improves their probability of admission, with potential heterogeneity across student subgroups (e.g., by socioeconomic status or parental education).

## 🔬 Methodology

Without full-text access, precise details must be inferred from the journal's methodological standards and the research question:

- **Likely Identification Strategy:** The study most probably employs a **quasi-experimental design** to address selection bias inherent in DE participation. Plausible approaches include:
  - **Propensity Score Matching (PSM)** or **inverse probability weighting (IPW)** to construct a comparable control group of non-DE students based on observable pre-treatment characteristics (GPA, demographics, school context).
  - **Instrumental Variables (IV)** using geographic proximity to DE-offering institutions or policy variation in DE availability/funding across districts as instruments.
  - **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)** exploiting staggered state or district-level policy changes that expanded DE access.
- **Data:** Likely uses large-scale administrative data linking high school records, DE participation, college application/admission records, and possibly National Student Clearinghouse data.
- **Outcomes:** Number of applications submitted, selectivity tier of institutions applied to (e.g., Barron's categories), admission rates, and enrollment decisions.

## 📊 Key Findings

Given the abstract's limited detail (no numerical effect sizes provided), anticipated findings based on the research design and literature include:

- DE participation likely **increases the probability of applying to and being admitted to more selective institutions**, consistent with the signaling and academic preparation mechanisms documented in prior work.
- Effects may be **heterogeneous by student background**, with potentially larger positive effects for underrepresented students, though this depends on the study's subgroup analyses.
- DE may serve as a **mechanism for broadening application sets**, encouraging students to apply to institutions they might otherwise have considered out of reach ("undermatching" reduction).
- Specific effect sizes (e.g., percentage-point increases in admission to selective institutions) are not available from the abstract alone.

## 💡 Relevance to My Research

This paper connects to your research agenda in several important ways:

1. **Intergenerational Educational Mobility:** Dual enrollment may function as a critical **mobility-enabling mechanism** by giving students from less-educated families exposure to college-level work and institutional environments before matriculation. If DE shifts application behavior toward more selective (and higher-return) institutions, it could be a lever for disrupting intergenerational reproduction of educational disadvantage.

2. **First-Generation College Students (FGCS):** FGCS face well-documented informational and cultural barriers in the college application process, including undermatching. This study likely speaks to whether DE **reduces information asymmetries** for FGCS—giving them academic confidence, transcript signals, and familiarity with higher education that their parents cannot provide. Any heterogeneous effects by parental education would be directly relevant.

3. **State Financial Aid Policy:** DE programs are overwhelmingly **funded and regulated at the state level**, making them a de facto state educational investment. This paper can inform your work on how state policy instruments beyond traditional financial aid (grants, loans) shape postsecondary access and stratification. The interaction between DE policy, state merit/need-based aid, and application/enrollment decisions is a rich area for your research.

4. **Policy Design Implications:** If DE disproportionately benefits already-advantaged students in application and admission outcomes, this raises equity concerns relevant to your interest in how state policies either ameliorate or reinforce stratification.

## ⭐ Key Quote Worth Citing

Unfortunately, the abstract provided contains no substantive text beyond bibliographic metadata ("Volume 97, Issue 1, null 2026, Page 58-89"). A verbatim quote cannot be extracted. **I strongly recommend accessing the full text** through your institutional library to identify key quotable passages, particularly any findings on heterogeneous effects by parental education or socioeconomic status that would directly support your FGCS and intergenerational mobility framing.

**Recommendation:** Given its placement in the *Journal of Higher Education* (a top-tier outlet) and its direct relevance to educational stratification mechanisms, this paper warrants a full read. Pay particular attention to (1) subgroup analyses by first-generation status, (2) the role of state policy context in moderating effects, and (3) whether the authors discuss DE as a complement or substitute for financial aid in promoting access to selective institutions.
