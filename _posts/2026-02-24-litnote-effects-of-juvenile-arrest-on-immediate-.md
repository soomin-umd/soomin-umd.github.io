# Analysis of "Effects of Juvenile Arrest on Immediate College Enrollment: The Role of Race/Ethnicity and Parental Education"

**Journal of Higher Education** | Published: 2026-02-24

## 📌 Core Research Question

This paper investigates how juvenile arrest affects the likelihood of immediate college enrollment following high school, with particular attention to how these effects vary by race/ethnicity and parental education level. The study essentially asks: Does contact with the juvenile justice system derail college-going trajectories, and are these impacts disproportionately borne by students of color and first-generation college students?

## 🔬 Methodology

Given the publication in a top-tier higher education journal and the causal language ("effects of"), the study likely employs one or more quasi-experimental identification strategies to address selection bias—since youth who experience arrest differ systematically from those who do not. Probable approaches include:

- **Propensity Score Matching (PSM)** or **Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW)**: Matching arrested youth with observationally similar non-arrested peers on pre-arrest characteristics (demographics, academic performance, socioeconomic background, neighborhood context) to construct a credible counterfactual.
- **Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM)** or **doubly robust estimation**: Increasingly common in criminology-education crossover research.
- The study likely draws on a **nationally representative longitudinal dataset** (e.g., NLSY97, Add Health, Education Longitudinal Study, or High School Longitudinal Study) that captures both justice system contact and postsecondary enrollment.
- **Heterogeneous treatment effects** are examined through interaction terms or stratified analyses by race/ethnicity (likely Black, Hispanic, White) and parental education (proxy for first-generation status).
- The outcome variable is **immediate/on-time college enrollment** (typically defined as enrolling in postsecondary education in the fall following high school completion).

## 📊 Key Findings

While the abstract is unavailable in full, based on the title, journal, and the established literature, the paper likely finds:

- Juvenile arrest has a **statistically significant negative effect** on immediate college enrollment, net of observable confounders.
- The negative effects are **heterogeneous by race/ethnicity**: Black and Hispanic youth who experience arrest likely face larger penalties to college enrollment than White youth, reflecting compounding disadvantages (labeling, stigma, institutional responses).
- **Parental education moderates the relationship**: Youth whose parents lack college degrees (i.e., prospective FGCS) are more negatively affected by arrest than peers with college-educated parents, who may possess social and cultural capital to buffer the impact (e.g., knowledge of legal systems, connections to educational advocates, financial resources).
- There may be **intersectional effects**, where being both a racial/ethnic minority and a first-generation student compounds the negative enrollment consequences of arrest.

## 💡 Relevance to My Research

This paper is highly relevant to your research agenda across all three dimensions:

- **Intergenerational educational mobility**: Juvenile arrest functions as a mechanism that disrupts upward mobility. If the effects are concentrated among students whose parents lack degrees, arrest becomes a structural barrier that reproduces educational inequality across generations. This aligns with theories of cumulative disadvantage and social reproduction.

- **First-generation college students (FGCS)**: By using parental education as a moderator, this paper directly illuminates how FGCS are differentially vulnerable to external shocks (justice system contact). It suggests that FGCS lack the "safety net" of parental college knowledge and navigational capital that could mitigate the effects of arrest on college plans.

- **State financial aid policy**: Many state financial aid programs (e.g., merit-based scholarships, need-based grants) include **criminal history exclusions** or require good conduct provisions. Juvenile arrest may disqualify students from certain aid or discourage application. This paper provides evidence that could inform policy debates around **"ban the box" in college admissions and financial aid**, as well as argue for targeted support programs for justice-involved youth—particularly those from first-generation and minority backgrounds.

This paper could be cited in your work to establish how non-academic institutional encounters (criminal justice) interact with family educational background to shape college access, reinforcing the importance of holistic state-level policies.

## ⭐ Key Quote Worth Citing

*(Note: The full abstract text was not provided in the prompt. Based on the title and research focus, a representative verbatim quote cannot be confirmed. I recommend retrieving the full abstract directly from the Journal of Higher Education to extract an exact citation. A likely quotable framing from such a paper would address the intersection of juvenile justice contact, racial disparities, and parental education in shaping college enrollment—central to your scholarly interests.)*

**Recommendation**: When the full text becomes available, pay special attention to (1) the magnitude of the parental education interaction effect, (2) whether the study distinguishes between two-year and four-year enrollment, and (3) any discussion of state-level policy variation in how juvenile records interact with college admissions or financial aid eligibility. These elements would be most directly useful for your dissertation.
