## 📌 Core Research Question

How do disparities in postsecondary enrollment based on disability status vary across students' socioeconomic status (SES), and to what extent do academic preparation and educational expectations account for these gaps? The study examines whether low-SES disabled students face compounded disadvantage in college access — particularly at four-year institutions — using a cumulative (dis)advantage framework.

## 🔬 Methodology

The study uses data from the **High School Longitudinal Study (HSLS:09)**, a nationally representative longitudinal dataset tracking U.S. students from 9th grade onward. While the abstract does not specify a precise quasi-experimental identification strategy (e.g., DiD, RD, IV), the analytical approach appears to be **observational/descriptive with sequential regression modeling** — a common approach in stratification research. Specifically:

- **Outcome**: Postsecondary enrollment (likely disaggregated by sector: four-year vs. two-year vs. no enrollment).
- **Key independent variables**: Disability status and SES (likely a composite or categorical measure).
- **Interaction/stratification**: Enrollment gaps by disability are examined *across SES strata*, suggesting either interaction terms or fully stratified models.
- **Sequential controls**: Academic preparation (e.g., course-taking, GPA, test scores) and educational expectations are added in subsequent model steps to assess mediation — i.e., how much of the disability-by-SES gap operates through these channels.

This is not a causal identification design per se, but rather a **decomposition strategy** aimed at understanding the structure of inequality at the intersection of disability and SES. The nationally representative sample with survey weights enhances external validity.

## 📊 Key Findings

- **Persistent enrollment gaps by disability status** exist across all SES levels, but the **greatest inequalities are concentrated among students from low-SES families**. This is consistent with a cumulative disadvantage pattern — disability and low SES compound rather than merely add.
- Gaps are **attenuated but not eliminated** after controlling for academic preparation and educational expectations, suggesting that these mediators explain part — but far from all — of the disability-SES enrollment penalty.
- **Disadvantage accumulates in distinct ways across institutional sectors**, implying that the disability gap may be particularly pronounced for four-year enrollment (where costs and complexity are highest) compared to two-year enrollment.
- Disabled students constitute **over one-fifth of U.S. college enrollments**, yet remain underrepresented relative to their population share, especially at four-year institutions.

## 💡 Relevance to My Research

This paper is highly relevant across all three pillars of your research agenda:

- **Intergenerational educational mobility**: The finding that disability-based enrollment gaps are largest among low-SES families speaks directly to how ascriptive characteristics (disability) interact with family origin to constrain upward mobility. Disabled students from disadvantaged backgrounds face a "double bind" that limits the postsecondary pathway most associated with intergenerational mobility — four-year college enrollment. This complements mobility research showing that barriers are not uniform but stratified by origin SES.

- **First-generation college students (FGCS)**: Low-SES disabled students are disproportionately likely to be FGCS. The paper's emphasis on the *additional costs and complexity* that disabled students face — navigating accommodations, documentation, specialized services — maps onto the literature on FGCS lacking institutional knowledge and social capital. The intersection of disability and first-generation status may represent an under-studied population in your work, and this paper provides a theoretical (cumulative disadvantage) and empirical foundation for investigating it.

- **State financial aid policy**: The authors explicitly call for policies targeting **financial and structural barriers** for disabled students. This has direct implications for state aid design: Are need-based aid programs sufficient for disabled students who face *above-average* college costs (assistive technology, personal care, transportation, reduced course loads extending time-to-degree)? State aid formulas that do not account for disability-related costs may inadvertently reproduce inequality even when they appear SES-targeted. This could inform your analysis of whether state aid programs have heterogeneous effects by disability status.

## ⭐ Key Quote Worth Citing

> "Disabled students make up over one-fifth of U.S. college enrollments, yet they remain less likely than their nondisabled peers to enter postsecondary education, especially four-year institutions. The additional costs and complexity that disabled students experience in college access are part of the reason for these disparities. Therefore, higher-SES students and families can leverage their resources and privileges to avoid or diminish some of these barriers, which may lead to exacerbated inequality among disabled students."
