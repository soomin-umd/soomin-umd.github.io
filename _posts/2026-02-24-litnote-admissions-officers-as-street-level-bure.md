## 📌 Core Research Question

How do admissions officers at selective higher education institutions exercise discretion when implementing holistic admissions practices, and how do their competing conceptions of equity shape decisions about access? The study frames admissions officers as **street-level bureaucrats** (drawing on Lipsky's framework), examining how individual-level discretion mediates institutional policy and produces potentially divergent equity outcomes.

## 🔬 Methodology

This is a **qualitative study** based on **51 semi-structured interviews** with admissions personnel. There is no quantitative identification strategy (no DiD, RD, IV, PSM, etc.). The analytical approach is interpretivist/inductive, likely employing thematic or grounded-theory-informed coding to surface patterns in how admissions officers describe their decision-making processes, the tensions they navigate, and the equity frameworks they invoke. The street-level bureaucracy theoretical lens provides the organizing framework for analyzing how front-line workers translate broad institutional mandates into concrete gatekeeping decisions. The study likely draws on admissions officers across multiple selective institutions (potentially in a comparative design), though the full sample details are truncated in the abstract.

## 📊 Key Findings

Specific effect sizes are not available given the qualitative design (and the article is ahead of print with a truncated abstract). Based on the framing, key findings likely include:

- Admissions officers hold **competing and sometimes contradictory conceptions of equity** (e.g., meritocratic fairness vs. compensatory justice vs. diversity rationales).
- **Discretion** is a central mechanism through which these competing conceptions are enacted—officers make case-by-case judgment calls that systematically advantage or disadvantage certain applicant profiles.
- Institutional policy provides broad holistic mandates but leaves substantial **interpretive latitude**, meaning equity outcomes depend heavily on the individual officer's framing.
- The tension between organizational pressures (rankings, revenue, yield) and equity commitments creates a space where discretionary decisions may **reproduce or disrupt** existing inequalities.

## 💡 Relevance to My Research

This paper is highly relevant on several dimensions:

- **First-generation college students (FGCS):** Holistic admissions is frequently positioned as a mechanism to improve access for FGCS, but this study reveals that the *implementation* of holistic review depends on individual officers' discretionary judgments. If admissions officers hold differing equity conceptions, FGCS may be evaluated inconsistently—sometimes benefiting from contextual review, sometimes disadvantaged by implicit deficit framing. This matters for understanding the gap between policy intent and realized FGCS enrollment.
- **Intergenerational educational mobility:** Selective institutions are key nodes in mobility pathways. If admissions gatekeeping is shaped by competing equity logics at the street level, then access to mobility-enabling institutions is not simply a function of stated policy but of bureaucratic discretion—adding a meso-level mechanism to your theoretical framework connecting family background to educational attainment.
- **State financial aid policy:** While the paper focuses on admissions rather than financial aid, the street-level bureaucracy framework is directly transferable. State financial aid administrators and institutional aid officers similarly exercise discretion in interpreting eligibility, packaging awards, and advising students—suggesting a parallel research agenda for how aid policy is enacted on the ground, with implications for FGCS and mobility.
