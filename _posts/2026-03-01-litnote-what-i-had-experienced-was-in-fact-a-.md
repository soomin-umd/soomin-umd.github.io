## 📌 Core Research Question

How do international students of color come to develop **critical racial consciousness** — that is, how do they learn to recognize, name, and make meaning of racialized experiences (including microaggressions) within U.S. higher education contexts? The study seeks to understand the **lived experience** of this developmental process, centering the phenomenological "essence" of becoming critically aware of race and racism as an international student who is also racialized as a person of color in the United States.

## 🔬 Methodology

This is a **qualitative phenomenological inquiry**, likely drawing on interpretive or transcendental phenomenology (e.g., Moustakas or van Manen traditions). The approach involves:

- **In-depth, semi-structured interviews** with international students of color at U.S. institutions, designed to elicit rich descriptions of lived experiences with race and racism.
- **Phenomenological data analysis** — likely involving horizonalization, identification of meaning units, textural and structural descriptions, and synthesis into an essential description of the phenomenon (developing critical racial consciousness).
- **Theoretical framing** probably draws on Critical Race Theory (CRT), racial microaggressions scholarship (Sue et al.), and potentially models of racial identity development or critical consciousness (e.g., Freire's conscientização adapted to race).
- **No quantitative identification strategy** (no DiD, RD, IV, PSM, etc.) — this is a purely qualitative, interpretivist study.

The phenomenological design is well-suited to capturing the subjective, processual nature of consciousness development that quantitative methods cannot access.

## 📊 Key Findings

Given the abstract is not fully available, based on the title and publication context, anticipated key findings include:

- International students of color undergo a **gradual, often retrospective process** of recognizing that ambiguous negative encounters were, in fact, racial microaggressions — as signaled by the title's quote: recognizing "what I had experienced was, in fact, a microaggression."
- The development of **critical racial consciousness** is not instantaneous but involves phases of confusion, self-doubt, education (formal and informal), peer validation, and eventual naming of racialized experiences.
- International students occupy a **unique positionality** — they may arrive without U.S.-specific racial frameworks and must learn to navigate a racial hierarchy in which they are newly positioned, creating a distinctive phenomenological trajectory distinct from domestic students of color.
- Institutional environments, peer networks, coursework, and cumulative experiences of marginalization likely serve as catalysts for consciousness development.

## 💡 Relevance to My Research

- **Intersections with FGCS experience:** Many international students of color are also first-generation students (globally or within their family's migration context). The process of developing racial consciousness parallels the **hidden curriculum** challenges FGCS face — both groups must acquire new frameworks for navigating institutional environments that were not designed for them. This study offers conceptual language (critical consciousness development) applicable to understanding how FGCS come to recognize class-based and race-based exclusions.
- **Intergenerational educational mobility:** International students of color pursuing U.S. degrees often represent significant intergenerational mobility trajectories in their home countries. Understanding how racialized campus climates affect their sense-making and belonging has implications for **whether mobility through education is experienced as liberatory or as introducing new forms of marginalization**.
- **State financial aid policy:** International students are typically excluded from state and federal financial aid, making them a useful contrast group. This study's findings about marginalization could inform arguments about **how exclusion from financial aid systems compounds racialized exclusion**, and it highlights an underexamined population in state-level policy discussions.
