# Analysis of "The Selectivity Divide: A Longitudinal Study of Religious Pluralism in United States Higher Education"

## 📌 Core Research Question

This study examines how religious pluralism (the diversity of religious identities and traditions represented on campus) varies across U.S. higher education institutions over time, with particular attention to whether institutional selectivity creates a "divide" in the degree of religious diversity students encounter. The core question is: How has religious pluralism evolved across differently selective sectors of American higher education, and what institutional characteristics predict greater or lesser religious diversity on campus?

## 🔬 Methodology

Without access to the full text beyond the empty abstract, precise identification strategy details are limited. However, based on the title's framing as a "longitudinal study," the methodology likely involves:

- **Longitudinal/panel data analysis** tracking religious composition at institutions over multiple time points
- Likely use of national survey datasets (e.g., HERI/CIRP Freshman Survey, NSSE, or similar large-scale instruments capturing students' religious identification)
- Descriptive and inferential analyses comparing religious pluralism indices (e.g., Herfindahl-type diversity indices) across selectivity tiers
- Potential use of **fixed effects models** to account for stable institutional characteristics over time
- Possible decomposition of changes in religious pluralism into between-institution vs. within-institution components

*Note: The abstract provided is empty (`<br />`), so methodological specifics cannot be confirmed. A full-text review is recommended.*

## 📊 Key Findings

Specific effect sizes and numerical results are unavailable due to the blank abstract. Based on the title, expected key findings likely include:

- A significant gap ("divide") in religious pluralism between more selective and less selective institutions
- Highly selective institutions may exhibit either greater religious homogeneity (e.g., secular/non-religious concentration) or greater cosmopolitan diversity, depending on admissions dynamics
- Temporal trends showing shifts in religious composition (e.g., growth of "nones"/religiously unaffiliated students) that may be unevenly distributed across selectivity tiers
- Institutional type (public vs. private, religiously affiliated vs. secular) likely interacts with selectivity in shaping pluralism

## 💡 Relevance to My Research

- **Intergenerational educational mobility**: Religious background is often intertwined with socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and geographic origin. If selectivity shapes religious pluralism, this may reflect and reinforce broader stratification patterns that affect who accesses elite vs. non-elite institutions — a core concern for mobility research.
- **First-generation college students (FGCS)**: FGCS disproportionately come from communities where religious identity is culturally central (e.g., rural, working-class, immigrant, and minoritized communities). Understanding the religious climate at institutions where FGCS enroll (often less selective) vs. where they are underrepresented (highly selective) can illuminate dimensions of campus belonging and cultural mismatch that affect persistence and completion.
- **State financial aid policy**: State aid policy shapes where students enroll across the selectivity spectrum. If aid programs steer students toward or away from certain institution types (including religiously affiliated institutions), this has implications for the diversity of environments students experience. Additionally, debates over state aid portability to religious institutions connect directly to this paper's institutional landscape.

**⚠️ Note to researcher:** The abstract provided was empty. This analysis is necessarily inferential, based on the title, journal, and publication date. I strongly recommend reviewing the full text to confirm methodology, findings, and to extract citable language. The *Journal of Higher Education* is a top-tier outlet, so the paper likely underwent rigorous peer review and may contain methodological innovations worth examining closely.
