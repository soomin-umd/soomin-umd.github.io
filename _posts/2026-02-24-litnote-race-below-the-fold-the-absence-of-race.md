# Race Below the Fold: The Absence of Race in the News Media's Coverage of Student Loans

## 📌 Core Research Question

How frequently and in what ways does news media coverage of student loans explicitly engage with race and racism? The study investigates whether the media discourse surrounding student debt adequately addresses the well-documented racial disparities in student borrowing, repayment, and default — or whether race is systematically marginalized ("below the fold") in this consequential policy conversation.

## 🔬 Methodology

Based on the title, journal, and abstract, this study likely employs a **qualitative or mixed-methods content/discourse analysis** of news media texts related to student loans. Key methodological features likely include:

- **Corpus construction**: Systematic collection of news articles from major media outlets over a defined time period, focused on student loan coverage
- **Critical discourse analysis (CDA)** or **content analysis**: Coding for explicit mentions of race, racism, racial disparities, and racially-specific framing in student loan stories
- **Frequency and thematic coding**: Quantifying the prevalence of racial language and categorizing how race is invoked (or absent) when present
- **Potentially a frame analysis approach**: Examining dominant frames (e.g., universal/race-neutral "crisis" framing vs. equity-focused framing) in media discourse

This is **not a causal identification strategy** (no DiD, RD, IV, or PSM). Rather, it sits within the tradition of **critical policy discourse analysis**, examining how media narratives shape the "problem definition" stage of the policy process — a tradition well-suited to *Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis*.

## 📊 Key Findings

While the full text is not available (ahead of print), the abstract and title strongly signal these findings:

- **Race is largely absent** from mainstream news media coverage of student loans, despite extensive evidence of stark racial disparities in student debt burdens (e.g., Black borrowers holding disproportionately more debt and experiencing higher default rates)
- The dominant media framing likely treats student debt as a **race-neutral, universal problem**, obscuring the racialized dimensions of the crisis
- When race does appear, it may be marginalized — literally or figuratively placed "below the fold" — suggesting it is treated as secondary or supplementary rather than central to the policy problem
- This absence has implications for how policymakers and the public understand the student loan crisis and which solutions are considered viable

## 💡 Relevance to My Research

This paper is highly relevant across all three of your research areas:

- **Intergenerational educational mobility**: The racialized student debt burden is a key mechanism through which educational stratification reproduces across generations. If media discourse ignores this, it obscures how debt constrains mobility differently by race — particularly for families without wealth to buffer borrowing. The race-neutral framing may mask how student debt *widens* intergenerational racial wealth gaps rather than serving as a mobility equalizer.

- **First-generation college students (FGCS)**: FGCS are disproportionately students of color and disproportionately reliant on loans. A media discourse that erases race from student debt conversations also erases the compounded disadvantage facing FGCS of color, who navigate both first-generation status and racial stratification in financing higher education.

- **State financial aid policy**: Media framing powerfully shapes the policy agenda. If the racial dimensions of student debt are absent from public discourse, state-level financial aid policies are more likely to adopt race-neutral designs (e.g., broad-based merit aid) rather than equity-targeted approaches — a finding you could use to motivate analyses of how policy design reflects (or ignores) racialized need.

This paper also offers a useful **theoretical and methodological complement** to quantitative policy analyses, demonstrating how the discursive environment constrains which policy solutions are politically imaginable.

## ⭐ Key Quote Worth Citing (verbatim from abstract)

> "The media discourse on student loans plays a significant role in the way that policy actors conceptualize challenges and potential solutions related to student debt."

*(Note: Given only partial abstract availability, this is the most complete verbatim segment. The full article likely contains more precise language about the findings regarding racial absence that would be worth citing once the full text is accessible.)*
