## 📌 Core Research Question

How do disparities in postsecondary enrollment based on disability status vary across students' socioeconomic status (SES), and to what extent do academic preparation and educational expectations explain these intersecting inequalities? The study is grounded in a **cumulative (dis)advantage** framework, examining whether low-SES disabled students face compounded barriers to college access—particularly at four-year institutions—relative to their higher-SES and/or nondisabled peers.

## 🔬 Methodology

The study uses data from the **High School Longitudinal Study (HSLS:09)**, a nationally representative longitudinal dataset maintained by NCES that follows a cohort of 9th graders through postsecondary transitions. This is a strong secondary data source for studying enrollment patterns by disability and SES.

**Identification strategy:** Based on the abstract, the analysis appears to rely on **descriptive/associational modeling** (likely logistic or multinomial logistic regression) rather than a strict causal identification strategy such as DiD, RD, or IV. The approach involves:

- Estimating enrollment gaps (any postsecondary enrollment, and likely by sector—two-year vs. four-year) by **disability status**, stratified or interacted with **SES**.
- Sequentially introducing controls for **academic preparation** (e.g., GPA, course-taking, test scores) and **educational expectations** to assess mediation—i.e., how much of the disability-by-SES gap is attenuated by these observed mechanisms.
- The interaction between disability and SES is the core analytic focus, consistent with a cumulative disadvantage lens.

No causal language is used in the abstract, suggesting the authors are careful to frame findings as descriptive/conditional associations. The use of HSLS survey weights likely ensures nationally representative estimates.

## 📊 Key Findings

- **Persistent enrollment gaps by disability status** were confirmed, with disabled students less likely to enroll in postsecondary education, especially four-year institutions.
- **The greatest inequalities were concentrated among students from low-SES families**—indicating that disability-based gaps are not uniform but are significantly exacerbated at the bottom of the SES distribution. This is the cumulative disadvantage finding: low SES + disability compounds barriers.
- Disparities were **attenuated but not eliminated** after accounting for academic preparation and educational expectations, meaning these mediators explain part—but only part—of the gap. Residual inequality likely reflects financial barriers, informational barriers, institutional accessibility issues, and other structural factors.
- **Disadvantage accumulates in distinct ways across sectors**, suggesting the patterns differ for two-year versus four-year enrollment (with four-year access likely showing the starkest SES × disability interaction).

Specific effect sizes are not available from the abstract alone.

## 💡 Relevance to My Research

This paper sits at a critical intersection with your research agenda in several ways:

1. **Intergenerational educational mobility:** Disability is an underexplored dimension of stratification in mobility research. This study demonstrates that the SES-enrollment gradient is steeper for disabled students, implying that **upward educational mobility is particularly constrained for disabled youth from low-SES origins**. This adds a crucial moderating variable to standard mobility frameworks.

2. **First-generation college students (FGCS):** Low-SES disabled students are disproportionately likely to be FGCS. The finding that academic preparation and expectations only partially mediate the gap suggests that FGCS-specific barriers (lack of parental college knowledge, navigational capital, understanding of disability services/accommodations) may be operative. The "additional costs and complexity" referenced in the abstract likely hit FGCS families hardest, as they lack the institutional knowledge to navigate disability accommodations alongside admissions and financial aid processes.

3. **State financial aid policy:** The study's emphasis on **financial and structural barriers** directly implicates the role of state financial aid. Most state aid programs are not designed with disability-related costs in mind (e.g., assistive technology, specialized housing, reduced course loads extending time-to-degree). Your research could examine whether state need-based aid programs differentially benefit disabled students, or whether merit-based programs (which rely on academic preparation metrics) inadvertently exclude the very population this study identifies as most disadvantaged.

This paper could motivate a research extension examining whether **state aid generosity moderates the disability × SES enrollment gap**.

## ⭐ Key Quote Worth Citing

> "Disabled students make up over one-fifth of U.S. college enrollments, yet they remain less likely than their nondisabled peers to enter postsecondary education, especially four-year institutions. The additional costs and complexity that disabled students experience in college access are part of the reason for these disparities. Therefore, higher-SES students and families can leverage their resources and privileges to avoid or diminish some of these barriers, which may lead to exacerbated inequality among disabled students."
