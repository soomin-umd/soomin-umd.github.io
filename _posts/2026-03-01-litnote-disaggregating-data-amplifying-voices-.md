## 📌 Core Research Question

How do academic outcomes and access to educational opportunity differ for Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NHPI) students when data are disaggregated from the broader "Asian" or "Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI)" racial category? The study seeks to illuminate disparities that are masked by aggregate reporting and to center the experiences of a historically underserved population.

## 🔬 Methodology

- **Framework:** Guided by **QuantCrit** (Quantitative Critical Race Theory), which foregrounds how racial categories in quantitative data can obscure inequities and calls for the critical interrogation of numbers, categories, and the structures that produce them.
- **Data:** Longitudinal administrative dataset from a **large urban school district in California**, which allows tracking of individual NHPI students over time.
- **Identification Strategy:** The abstract does not specify a causal identification strategy (e.g., DiD, RD, IV). Based on the framing, the study likely employs **descriptive and inferential longitudinal analyses** — comparing disaggregated NHPI student outcomes to other racial/ethnic groups and to the aggregated AAPI category. The emphasis on disaggregation itself is methodological: demonstrating how collapsing NHPI students into broader categories conceals disparities. Regression-based approaches controlling for student- and school-level characteristics are probable, though the truncated abstract limits specificity.
- **Analytical Contribution:** The "amplifying voices" component in the title suggests possible integration of **qualitative or mixed-methods** elements, or at minimum a deliberate interpretive lens informed by community perspectives.

## 📊 Key Findings

The abstract is truncated ("we find that NHPI students are…"), but based on the title and QuantCrit framing, the findings almost certainly show that:

- **NHPI students experience significantly worse academic outcomes** (e.g., GPA, graduation rates, college readiness indicators) than their peers when data are properly disaggregated.
- **Aggregation under the AAPI umbrella masks these disparities**, as outcomes for East and South Asian students inflate the combined group's averages.
- **Access to opportunity structures** (e.g., advanced coursework, college-preparatory tracks, experienced teachers) is likely unequal for NHPI students.

*(Specific effect sizes are not available from the truncated abstract.)*

## 💡 Relevance to My Research

- **Intergenerational educational mobility:** NHPI communities have among the lowest rates of bachelor's degree attainment of any racial/ethnic group in the U.S. Data disaggregation research like this reveals the structural barriers that impede upward educational mobility across generations — barriers invisible when NHPI students are collapsed into "Asian" categories that show high aggregate attainment.
- **First-generation college students (FGCS):** NHPI students are disproportionately likely to be FGCS given lower parental educational attainment. Understanding their K–12 academic trajectories and opportunity gaps is essential for designing interventions that support their college access and success.
- **State financial aid policy:** California is a critical policy context (Cal Grant, Middle Class Scholarship, community college fee waivers). If NHPI students are systematically underperforming in K–12 due to lack of access to opportunity, they may also be less likely to meet GPA thresholds for merit-based state aid. This study provides an evidentiary foundation for arguing that **state financial aid eligibility criteria and outreach should be informed by disaggregated data** to avoid perpetuating inequities hidden by aggregate racial categories.
- **Methodological lesson:** The QuantCrit approach offers a model for how I might critically examine whether aggregate data categories in my own research on FGCS and state aid obscure heterogeneity — for example, within "first-generation" status across different racial/ethnic communities.
