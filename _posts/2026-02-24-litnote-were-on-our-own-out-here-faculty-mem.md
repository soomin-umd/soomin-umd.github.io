# Analysis of "We're on Our Own Out Here": Faculty Member Responses to Legislative Threats to Academic Freedom and Scholarship on Race

## 📌 Core Research Question

How do faculty members perceive, experience, and respond to state-level legislative efforts that restrict or threaten academic freedom—particularly regarding the teaching of race, racism, and related critical scholarship (e.g., so-called "anti-CRT" laws and "divisive concepts" bills)? The study likely explores how these legislative threats shape faculty teaching, research, and self-censorship behaviors within higher education institutions.

## 🔬 Methodology

Based on the title, journal, and topic, this study almost certainly employs a **qualitative research design**—likely:

- **Semi-structured interviews** with faculty members across institutions in states that have proposed or enacted legislation restricting teaching on race
- Possibly supplemented by **document analysis** of legislative texts and institutional communications
- **Thematic or narrative analysis** to identify patterns in faculty experiences and responses
- The sample likely spans multiple institution types and disciplines, with purposeful sampling of faculty who teach race-related content

**No quantitative identification strategy** (DiD, RD, IV, PSM) is employed. This is an interpretivist/qualitative study focused on lived experience and meaning-making rather than causal inference. The "identification strategy" here is the rigorous qualitative coding process and trustworthiness criteria (member checking, thick description, positionality statements, etc.).

## 📊 Key Findings

Without access to the full text (and given the abstract provided is essentially blank), anticipated key findings based on the title and framing include:

- Faculty report feeling **isolated and unsupported** by their institutions ("We're on our own out here" signals a lack of institutional backing)
- Evidence of **chilling effects**: faculty self-censor course content, modify syllabi, or avoid certain research topics related to race
- **Varied institutional responses**: some institutions offer legal guidance or public statements while others remain silent, leaving faculty exposed
- Faculty experience **emotional toll**, anxiety, and professional uncertainty tied to the political environment
- Responses may differ by **institutional type** (public vs. private), **tenure status**, **discipline**, and **faculty race/identity**

*(Specific numbers/effect sizes are not applicable given the qualitative design.)*

## 💡 Relevance to My Research

This paper connects to your research agenda in several important ways:

- **State policy environment**: Just as you study how **state financial aid policy** shapes educational opportunity, this paper examines how **state legislative action** shapes the educational environment—both represent the state as a critical policy actor in higher education. Understanding the broader political context in which state aid operates is essential, as restrictive legislation may interact with aid policy to shape campus climate and student experience.
- **First-generation college students (FGCS)**: FGCS disproportionately attend public institutions most directly affected by these laws. If faculty self-censor or reduce engagement with race-related content, this can diminish the **culturally sustaining pedagogy** and **sense of belonging** that support FGCS retention and success—particularly FGCS of color.
- **Intergenerational educational mobility**: Scholarship on race in higher education is foundational to understanding structural barriers to mobility. If state legislation constrains the knowledge ecosystem (what can be taught, researched, and discussed), it may indirectly constrain the **institutional capacity** to address inequities that impede intergenerational mobility.
- **Methodological complement**: As a researcher likely working with quantitative policy data, this qualitative study offers a model for understanding the **mechanisms** through which policy environments affect educational actors—a useful complement when interpreting quantitative findings.

## ⭐ Key Quote Worth Citing (verbatim from abstract)

*Unfortunately, the abstract provided is effectively blank (containing only an HTML break tag), so a verbatim quote cannot be extracted. However, the title itself is a direct participant quote worth citing:*

> **"We're on Our Own Out Here"**

This phrase powerfully captures faculty perceptions of institutional abandonment in the face of political threats to academic freedom—and would be a compelling citation when discussing how state-level policy climates affect the educators who serve first-generation students and students from marginalized backgrounds.

**Note:** I recommend accessing the full text through your institutional library to extract specific findings and direct quotes, as the abstract provided was not substantive. The *Journal of Higher Education* is a top-tier venue, and this paper likely offers rigorous qualitative evidence on a topic increasingly relevant to state higher education policy research.
