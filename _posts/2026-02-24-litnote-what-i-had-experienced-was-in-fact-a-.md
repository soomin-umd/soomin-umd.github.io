# Analysis of "What I Had Experienced Was, in Fact, a Microaggression": A Phenomenological Inquiry into International Students of Color Developing Critical Racial Consciousness

## 📌 Core Research Question

How do international students of color come to develop critical racial consciousness—specifically, how do they come to recognize, name, and make meaning of their racialized experiences (such as microaggressions) within U.S. higher education contexts? The study seeks to understand the phenomenological process by which students who were racialized differently (or not at all) in their home countries come to understand themselves through the lens of race in the American context.

## 🔬 Methodology

This is a **qualitative phenomenological study**, not a quantitative causal identification design. Key methodological details likely include:

- **Phenomenological inquiry** (likely drawing on interpretive/hermeneutic or transcendental phenomenology, possibly Moustakas or van Manen's frameworks)
- **In-depth semi-structured interviews** with international students of color at U.S. institutions
- **Purposeful sampling** of participants who self-identify as international students and as people of color/racialized minorities in the U.S. context
- **Data analysis** involving coding for themes, meaning units, textural and structural descriptions, and the identification of the "essence" of the experience of developing critical racial consciousness
- **Theoretical framing** likely draws on Critical Race Theory (CRT), racial microaggressions literature (Sue et al.), and possibly models of racial identity development

**Note:** No quantitative identification strategy (DiD, RD, IV, PSM, etc.) is employed. This is an interpretivist, experience-centered study.

## 📊 Key Findings

Given the limited abstract provided, specific findings must be inferred from the title and the journal's scope. Likely key findings include:

- International students of color undergo a **process of racial awakening** upon encountering the U.S. racial hierarchy, moving from unfamiliarity with American racial categories to critical awareness
- Participants came to **retroactively name experiences as microaggressions**—the title's quote ("What I had experienced was, in fact, a microaggression") signals a turning point in consciousness
- The development of critical racial consciousness is likely **nonlinear and mediated** by factors such as peer networks, academic coursework (e.g., exposure to CRT or ethnic studies), duration in the U.S., and campus racial climate
- Participants likely experienced **intersectional marginalization**—navigating both xenophobia/nativism (as international students) and racism (as people of color)
- The study likely identifies distinct **phases or dimensions** of consciousness development (e.g., encounters, confusion, naming, critical understanding, resistance/agency)

Specific effect sizes are not applicable given the qualitative design.

## 💡 Relevance to My Research

While this study does not directly address intergenerational educational mobility, FGCS, or state financial aid policy, there are several meaningful connections:

- **First-generation and international student intersections:** Many international students of color are also first-generation college students in their families (first to attend higher education in any country, or first to attend in the U.S.). The racialized experiences documented here may compound the challenges FGCS face regarding belonging, cultural capital, and institutional navigation.
- **Campus climate as a mediator of educational attainment:** Your research on intergenerational mobility could benefit from understanding how racialized campus environments affect persistence and degree completion for students of color—including international FGCS—which in turn affects mobility outcomes.
- **State financial aid policy:** International students are typically **excluded** from state and federal financial aid, creating a unique structural vulnerability. This study implicitly highlights how policy exclusions intersect with racialized experiences to shape educational trajectories. If your work examines equity in state aid, the exclusion of this population is a relevant boundary condition to acknowledge.
- **Conceptual broadening:** This paper could push your theoretical framing to consider how racial consciousness and racialization processes interact with socioeconomic mobility aspirations, particularly for immigrant and transnational families where intergenerational mobility operates across national contexts.

## ⭐ Key Quote Worth Citing (verbatim from abstract)

*Note: A fuller citation from the abstract or body text would require access to the complete article. The publication date of 2026 suggests this may be a forthcoming or advance-access piece, which may explain the incomplete abstract. I recommend retrieving the full text from the Journal of Higher Education for more detailed engagement.*
