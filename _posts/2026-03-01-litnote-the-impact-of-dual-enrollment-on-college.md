# Analysis of "The Impact of Dual Enrollment on College Application Choice and Admission Success"

**Journal of Higher Education**, Volume 97, Issue 1, 2026, pp. 58–89

## 📌 Core Research Question

How does participation in dual enrollment (DE) programs—where high school students take college-level courses for credit—affect students' college application behaviors (e.g., the selectivity and number of institutions to which they apply) and their subsequent admission outcomes? The study likely examines whether DE serves as a mechanism that shapes postsecondary sorting, potentially enabling students to aim higher in the institutional selectivity hierarchy.

## 🔬 Methodology

Without full-text access, the specific identification strategy cannot be confirmed with certainty, but given the publication venue (a top-tier higher education journal), the topic, and the 2026 date, the study most likely employs one or more of the following quasi-experimental approaches:

- **Propensity Score Matching (PSM)** or **Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW)** to construct a credible comparison group of non-DE participants who share similar observable pre-treatment characteristics (prior academic achievement, demographics, school context).
- Possible **Instrumental Variables (IV)** strategy, leveraging variation in DE availability across schools or districts (e.g., proximity to a community college partner, state/district policy mandates) as an instrument for DE participation.
- Possible **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)** design if the study exploits staggered rollout of DE programs or policy changes across states/districts over time.
- The study likely draws on **administrative data** (state longitudinal data systems linking K-12 records to postsecondary application/enrollment records), potentially supplemented with data from clearinghouses like the National Student Clearinghouse or Common Application data.

Sensitivity analyses likely address selection on unobservables (e.g., Rosenbaum bounds, coefficient stability tests à la Oster 2019).

## 📊 Key Findings

Given the abstract's limited detail ("null" descriptor suggests truncated metadata), precise effect sizes are not available from the abstract alone. However, based on the title and the existing literature trajectory, the study likely finds:

- **DE participants apply to more selective institutions** than observationally similar non-participants, with the effect potentially representing a meaningful shift in application tier (e.g., a shift of several points on a Barron's selectivity scale or a significant increase in mean SAT score of applied-to institutions).
- **Positive effects on admission success**, suggesting that DE participation both signals academic readiness and provides tangible preparation that admissions committees recognize.
- **Heterogeneous effects** likely emerge by socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, or first-generation status—a central concern for equity-minded researchers. DE may have especially strong "horizon-broadening" effects for underrepresented students, or alternatively, benefits may accrue disproportionately to already-advantaged students (a "Matthew effect").
- The study may find that DE narrows or widens gaps in **undermatch**—the phenomenon where academically qualified students apply to and enroll in institutions below their achievement level.

## 💡 Relevance to My Research

This paper is highly relevant across all three dimensions of your research agenda:

1. **Intergenerational Educational Mobility**: Dual enrollment may function as a critical mechanism for disrupting the reproduction of educational inequality. If DE enables students from less-educated family backgrounds to aim higher in their application portfolios and gain admission to more selective institutions, it represents a concrete policy lever for upward mobility. Conversely, if DE benefits are captured primarily by advantaged families, it may reinforce existing stratification.

2. **First-Generation College Students (FGCS)**: FGCS often face informational barriers and constrained "college knowledge" that lead to undermatch. DE programs expose students to college-level academic norms and institutional environments, potentially compensating for the lack of parental college experience. This study likely provides evidence on whether DE helps FGCS expand their application horizons—a finding directly applicable to your work.

3. **State Financial Aid Policy**: DE programs are frequently funded or subsidized through state policy (e.g., state-mandated tuition waivers for DE students). Understanding the downstream effects of DE on application and admission outcomes helps evaluate the full return on investment of state spending. This connects to your interest in how state-level policy configurations—including both financial aid and academic preparation programs—shape postsecondary access and success.

The paper could serve as a strong complement to research on state merit aid, need-based aid, and Promise programs, framing DE as a **non-financial** (or indirectly financial) state intervention that shapes college choice.

## ⭐ Key Quote Worth Citing

Unfortunately, the abstract metadata provided is truncated (listed as "null"), and no substantive text from the abstract is available for verbatim citation. I recommend accessing the full article via the *Journal of Higher Education* (Vol. 97, No. 1, 2026, pp. 58–89) to extract a direct quotable passage. Key sections to target for citation would be the abstract's summary of heterogeneous effects by parental education or socioeconomic background, and any framing
