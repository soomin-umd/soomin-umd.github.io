## 📌 Core Research Question

How effective have school finance reforms (SFRs) been at reducing **racial/ethnic disparities** in school funding, given that funding has become more economically progressive but remains unequal along racial/ethnic lines? The paper examines whether SFRs—historically designed around economic equity—can serve as a viable mechanism for closing racial funding gaps, especially as court-ordered desegregation efforts have waned.

## 🔬 Methodology

Based on the abstract and the journal's methodological standards, the study most likely employs a **difference-in-differences (DiD)** or **event-study** framework exploiting the staggered adoption of school finance reforms across states over time. This is the canonical identification strategy in the SFR literature (following Jackson, Johnson, & Persico, 2016; Lafortune, Rothstein, & Schanzenbach, 2018). The researchers likely:

- Compare changes in per-pupil funding across districts with varying racial/ethnic compositions before and after state-level SFR implementation
- Decompose funding progressivity along **economic** versus **racial/ethnic** dimensions to show that gains on the economic equity margin have not equivalently translated to racial equity
- May use district-level fiscal data (e.g., F-33 Census of Governments) merged with demographic data over multiple decades
- Potentially account for the declining role of desegregation orders as a separate policy lever, allowing them to isolate the SFR channel

The title's emphasis on "slow progress" suggests the analysis tracks cumulative, long-run effects rather than immediate post-reform impacts.

## 📊 Key Findings

While specific effect sizes are not available from the truncated abstract, the core findings appear to be:

- SFRs have successfully increased **economic progressivity** of school funding (more dollars flowing to economically disadvantaged districts)
- However, SFRs have been **substantially less effective**—or ineffective—at closing **racial/ethnic funding gaps**
- Progress on racial equity in funding has been **slow** relative to economic equity, suggesting that race-neutral, income-based reform designs leave racial disparities partially or largely intact
- The decline of desegregation efforts has removed a key complementary mechanism, making the limitations of SFRs on the racial equity dimension more consequential

## 💡 Relevance to My Research

This paper is highly relevant across all three of your research streams:

- **Intergenerational educational mobility**: School funding is a critical input into educational quality. If racial funding gaps persist despite SFRs, this implies that the "opportunity structure" remains stratified by race, constraining upward intergenerational mobility for students of color—even when economic progressivity improves. This connects to whether place-based investments translate into mobility gains equitably across racial groups.

- **First-generation college students (FGCS)**: FGCS are disproportionately students of color and from under-resourced K–12 systems. Persistent racial funding gaps in K–12 directly shape the college readiness pipeline, meaning that FGCS from racially underfunded districts may face compounded disadvantages that neither K–12 finance reforms nor higher education access policies fully address.

- **State financial aid policy**: The paper highlights a broader lesson about the limits of **race-neutral, economically targeted** policy design—a tension that directly parallels debates in state financial aid (e.g., need-based aid formulas that are income-progressive but may not close racial gaps in college affordability or completion). It provides an empirical foundation for arguing that state aid policies must be evaluated along both economic *and* racial equity dimensions.
