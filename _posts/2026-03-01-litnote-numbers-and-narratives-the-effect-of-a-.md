## 📌 Core Research Question

Does a combined information and video role model intervention reduce socioeconomic inequalities in the transition from high school to university in Denmark, and through what mechanisms (expectations, information updating, identification with role models) does it operate?

## 🔬 Methodology

This is a **randomized controlled trial (RCT)** — the gold standard for causal identification in intervention research. The study employs a **field experiment** in Danish high schools, combining two treatment components:

1. **Information provision** — likely addressing knowledge gaps about university costs, returns, and application processes.
2. **Video role model intervention** — featuring relatable figures (presumably from underrepresented backgrounds) who successfully navigated the transition to university.

The identification strategy relies on **random assignment** of students (or school clusters) to treatment vs. control conditions, allowing for unbiased estimation of average treatment effects. The study likely examines **heterogeneous treatment effects** by parental education / socioeconomic background to assess whether the intervention specifically closes gaps for disadvantaged students. Outcomes appear to include both **intermediate mechanisms** (expectations of attending university, information updating, role model identification) and likely **behavioral outcomes** (actual university enrollment), though the abstract primarily references expectation shifts.

## 📊 Key Findings

- The intervention produced a **significant increase in expectations** of attending university among treated students.
- The abstract indicates effects on reducing **inequalities** — suggesting the treatment effects were **concentrated among or larger for students from non-university-educated (lower SES) families**, consistent with a gap-closing mechanism.
- Specific effect sizes are not fully available from the truncated abstract, but the framing in *EEPA* suggests policy-relevant magnitudes.

## 💡 Relevance to My Research

This paper is **highly relevant** across multiple dimensions of your research agenda:

- **First-Generation College Students (FGCS):** The intervention directly targets the information and aspirational barriers that disproportionately affect FGCS. Role model interventions address the "possible selves" gap — FGCS often lack proximate examples of successful university navigation. This connects to your work on how family educational history shapes college-going behavior.
- **Intergenerational Educational Mobility:** By demonstrating that a relatively low-cost intervention can shift university expectations differentially by parental background, the study provides evidence on **malleable mechanisms** underlying intergenerational persistence in education. It suggests that part of the intergenerational transmission of educational attainment operates through information and identity channels, not just financial constraints.
- **State Financial Aid Policy:** While set in Denmark (a low-tuition, generous-aid context with SU grants), the study is a powerful complement to financial aid research. It suggests that **even when financial barriers are minimal**, information and psychosocial barriers persist — implying that financial aid policy alone may be insufficient to close mobility gaps. This is a critical insight for U.S. policy debates about whether aid simplification and information interventions should accompany funding.
- The Danish setting also allows you to argue that **inequality in access is not solely a function of cost** — a point that strengthens the case for holistic policy approaches combining aid with outreach.
