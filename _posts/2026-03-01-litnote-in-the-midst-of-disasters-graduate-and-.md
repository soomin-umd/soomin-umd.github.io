# Analysis of "In the Midst of Disasters: Graduate and Undergraduate Tuition Fee Elasticity in Puerto Rico"

**Journal:** Research in Higher Education
**Date:** 2026-02-25

## 📌 Core Research Question

This paper examines how sensitive enrollment demand is to changes in tuition fees (i.e., tuition fee elasticity) for both graduate and undergraduate students in Puerto Rico, set against the context of multiple overlapping disasters (likely including Hurricane Maria in 2017, subsequent earthquakes, fiscal austerity under the PROMESA/fiscal oversight board, and potentially COVID-19). The study likely asks: How do tuition price changes affect enrollment in a context of compounding economic and natural disasters, and do these elasticities differ between undergraduate and graduate levels?

## 🔬 Methodology

Without the full abstract text, based on the title, journal, and topic, the study likely employs:

- **Panel data econometric models** estimating tuition elasticity of demand using institutional-level enrollment and tuition data across Puerto Rico's higher education institutions over time
- Possible **fixed effects models** controlling for institution and year heterogeneity
- Potential **instrumental variable (IV) approach** or **difference-in-differences (DiD)** design leveraging exogenous shocks from disasters (hurricanes, earthquakes, fiscal crisis) as natural experiments that shifted tuition pricing or institutional aid
- Separate estimation of elasticity coefficients for **graduate vs. undergraduate** populations to compare price sensitivity across levels
- Data sources likely include IPEDS, Puerto Rico's Council on Education, or institutional administrative data

## 📊 Key Findings

Specific effect sizes are unavailable without the abstract content, but anticipated findings include:

- Undergraduate enrollment is likely **more price-elastic** than commonly found in mainland U.S. studies, given Puerto Rico's lower median household income and constrained financial aid landscape
- Graduate enrollment may exhibit **different (potentially lower) elasticity**, reflecting distinct demand structures
- Disaster contexts likely **amplify price sensitivity**, as household resources are depleted and opportunity costs shift
- Possible differential effects across institutional types (public UPR system vs. private institutions)

## 💡 Relevance to My Research

This paper is highly relevant across all three of your research areas:

- **Intergenerational educational mobility:** Puerto Rico represents a unique case where compounding crises—fiscal austerity, natural disasters, and population outmigration—threaten the pipeline through which lower-income families access higher education. Tuition sensitivity is a direct mechanism through which economic shocks can disrupt intergenerational mobility, particularly in a territory where educational attainment has historically been a key vehicle for upward mobility.

- **First-generation college students (FGCS):** FGCS are disproportionately price-sensitive and likely overrepresented among those whose enrollment decisions are most affected by tuition changes in disaster contexts. Puerto Rico's high poverty rate (~43%) means a substantial share of potential students are first-generation, and disaster-induced tuition elasticity effects may serve as a proxy for understanding FGCS vulnerability to price shocks more broadly.

- **State financial aid policy:** Puerto Rico occupies a unique position—subject to federal financial aid (Pell Grants) but lacking robust state-level grant programs comparable to mainland states. The study likely illuminates what happens to price sensitivity when state/territorial safety nets are thin and external shocks are severe, offering a cautionary case for financial aid policy design. This has implications for how states should structure aid to buffer enrollment against economic disruptions.

## ⭐ Key Quote Worth Citing

*(The full abstract was not provided, so a verbatim quote cannot be extracted. I recommend pulling the exact elasticity estimates and any framing language about disaster contexts compounding price sensitivity for FGCS-adjacent populations once you access the full text.)*

**Note:** This analysis is constructed with the title, journal, and date as primary inputs, since the abstract field appears blank. I strongly recommend revisiting this analysis once the full abstract and paper are accessible—particularly to capture exact elasticity coefficients, which would be valuable for contextualizing mainland U.S. financial aid policy effects in your own work. The Puerto Rico context offers a compelling "stress test" case for theories about how financial aid mediates access for disadvantaged and first-generation populations.
