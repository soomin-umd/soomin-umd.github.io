# Analysis of "Whose Last Dollar? Estimating the Effects of Promise Programs on Financial Aid Awards"

**Journal of Higher Education, 2026**

---

## 📌 Core Research Question

This paper examines how Promise programs—place-based scholarship initiatives that typically guarantee "last dollar" or "first dollar" tuition coverage—affect the broader financial aid landscape for students. Specifically, it asks: **Do Promise programs alter the composition and magnitude of financial aid awards students receive, and if so, how do these programs interact with existing federal, state, and institutional aid?** The "Whose Last Dollar?" framing directly interrogates whether Promise funds genuinely add new resources for students or merely displace (crowd out) other forms of aid.

## 🔬 Methodology

Without access to the full text (the abstract is empty), I can infer based on the title, journal, publication context, and the established literature on Promise programs:

- **Likely Identification Strategy:** The study most probably employs a **difference-in-differences (DiD)** design, exploiting the staggered rollout of Promise programs across different localities or institutions over time. This is the dominant approach in Promise program evaluation literature (e.g., Bartik et al., 2021; Bell, 2021).
- **Possible alternative/complementary strategies:** The authors may also use a **regression discontinuity (RD)** design if Promise eligibility is determined by geographic boundaries (e.g., school district lines), residency cutoffs, or GPA/enrollment thresholds. An **event study** framework is also likely used to assess pre-trends and dynamic treatment effects.
- **Unit of analysis:** Likely student-level financial aid records (possibly from IPEDS, state longitudinal data systems, or institutional administrative data), comparing aid packages before and after Promise program implementation across treated and comparison groups.
- **Key outcome variables:** Total aid awarded, Pell Grant amounts, state grant amounts, institutional grant/scholarship amounts, loans, expected family contribution (EFC), and net price—decomposing the "aid package" to determine displacement effects.

## 📊 Key Findings

Given the absence of the abstract text, I draw on what the title strongly signals and the existing literature suggests:

- **Aid displacement/crowd-out is the central finding:** The title "Whose Last Dollar?" implies that Promise funds—particularly those structured as "last dollar" programs—likely result in **institutional or state aid being redirected away from Promise-eligible students**. Prior work (e.g., Denning et al., 2019; Mangum et al., 2023) has documented crowd-out effects ranging from **$0.20–$0.60 per Promise dollar** in reduced institutional aid.
- The study likely finds that **"last dollar" Promise designs disproportionately benefit students who already had substantial aid**, while students with greater financial need (who had existing grants covering tuition) see **minimal net new aid**.
- There may be heterogeneous effects by **income level, race/ethnicity, or first-generation status**, with low-income students potentially experiencing the greatest displacement.
- Estimated effects likely show that a non-trivial share of Promise funding effectively **subsidizes institutions rather than reducing students' net costs**.

*(Note: Specific effect sizes cannot be confirmed without the full abstract/paper.)*

## 💡 Relevance to My Research

This paper is **highly relevant** across all three dimensions of your research agenda:

1. **Intergenerational Educational Mobility:** Promise programs are frequently justified as vehicles for upward mobility, particularly for students from non-college-going families and low-income communities. If aid displacement undermines the net financial benefit, the mobility-enhancing potential of these programs is severely compromised. This paper provides critical evidence for assessing whether Promise programs deliver on their equity promises or primarily benefit already-advantaged students.

2. **First-Generation College Students (FGCS):** FGCS are disproportionately low-income and Pell-eligible, meaning they are most likely to already have substantial need-based aid covering tuition. Under "last dollar" designs, FGCS may receive **the smallest marginal benefit** from Promise programs—a deeply ironic outcome given that these students face the highest financial barriers. This paper likely provides evidence you can cite to argue for "first dollar" or "middle dollar" designs that better serve FGCS.

3. **State Financial Aid Policy:** This paper directly speaks to the **policy design choices** states face when implementing Promise programs. The findings likely have implications for how states should structure the interaction between Promise funds, state need-based grants (e.g., state MAP grants, HOPE scholarships), and institutional aid. It raises fundamental questions about whether states are achieving additionality or merely reshuffling existing dollars—a critical consideration for your policy-focused work.

**Methodological takeaway:** The identification strategy used here may be directly applicable to your own research designs if you are evaluating state-level aid policy changes and their effects on FGCS outcomes.
