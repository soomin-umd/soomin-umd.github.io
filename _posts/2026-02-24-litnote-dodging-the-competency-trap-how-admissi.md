# Analysis of "Dodging the Competency Trap? How Admissions and Financial Aid Offices Adapted to Test-Optional Policies After COVID-19"

## 📌 Core Research Question

How did admissions and financial aid offices organizationally adapt their practices and routines in response to the widespread adoption of test-optional policies following COVID-19? The paper likely draws on organizational theory — specifically the concept of the "competency trap" (where organizations cling to established routines even when environments change) — to examine whether these offices genuinely transformed their evaluation processes or merely superficially adjusted while maintaining pre-existing institutional logics around standardized testing.

## 🔬 Methodology

Based on the title's framing and the *Journal of Higher Education*'s methodological tendencies, this is most likely a **qualitative or mixed-methods organizational study**. The probable approach includes:

- **Semi-structured interviews** with admissions officers and financial aid administrators across multiple institutions
- **Case study design** — possibly comparative cases across institution types (e.g., selective vs. open-access; public vs. private)
- **Document analysis** of institutional policies, communications, and procedural manuals pre- and post-COVID
- **Organizational theory framework** — drawing on competency trap theory (Levitt & March, 1988) and possibly institutional isomorphism to analyze how deeply embedded routines around test scores were disrupted or maintained
- No traditional causal identification strategy (DiD, RD, IV) — this appears to be an interpretivist/qualitative study focused on organizational adaptation processes

## 📊 Key Findings

Given the abstract's limited information, anticipated key findings likely include:

- Admissions and financial aid offices varied significantly in how substantively (vs. symbolically) they adapted to test-optional environments
- Some offices successfully "dodged" the competency trap by redesigning holistic review processes, while others reverted to test-score reliance when scores were available
- Financial aid offices may have faced particular challenges, as many merit aid formulas were algorithmically tied to standardized test scores, creating structural inertia
- Institutional selectivity and resource levels likely moderated the depth of adaptation
- Tensions emerged between stated test-optional policies and the continued operational use of scores in packaging financial aid

*Specific effect sizes are unavailable given the limited abstract information provided.*

## 💡 Relevance to My Research

This paper is **highly relevant** across all three dimensions of your research agenda:

- **First-Generation College Students (FGCS):** Test-optional policies disproportionately affect FGCS, who are less likely to have access to test preparation resources. How admissions and especially *financial aid offices* operationalize test-optional policies directly shapes whether FGCS gain equitable access to both admission and affordability. If financial aid formulas still privilege test scores, FGCS who choose not to submit scores may be disadvantaged in merit aid packaging — a hidden barrier.

- **State Financial Aid Policy:** Many state-level merit aid programs (e.g., Georgia HOPE, Florida Bright Futures) historically incorporated standardized test thresholds. This paper likely speaks to the tension between institutional test-optional policies and state-level financial aid eligibility criteria that may still require scores, creating policy misalignment that disproportionately affects students from lower-SES backgrounds.

- **Intergenerational Educational Mobility:** If the organizational adaptation is shallow — if offices are merely "dodging" rather than genuinely transforming — then test-optional policies may function as performative equity gestures that do not meaningfully disrupt the reproduction of educational advantage. This has direct implications for whether the post-COVID policy shift actually promotes upward intergenerational mobility or merely reshuffles existing inequalities.

This paper could serve as a useful counterpoint in your work to argue that *policy adoption alone is insufficient* — implementation fidelity at the organizational level mediates whether state and institutional policies achieve their equity goals.

## ⭐ Key Quote Worth Citing (verbatim from abstract)

*Unfortunately, the abstract provided contains only the volume/issue metadata:* "Volume 97, Issue 1, null 2026, Page 148-172."

No substantive abstract text was available for verbatim citation. **I recommend accessing the full text via your institutional library to extract a direct quote**, particularly any language about how financial aid packaging practices did or did not change — this would be most citable for your FGCS and state financial aid policy work.

**Recommendation:** Prioritize reading the financial aid sections of this paper closely. The admissions side of test-optional has received substantial attention, but the *financial aid implementation* dimension is underexplored and directly connects to your research on state aid policy and FGCS access.
