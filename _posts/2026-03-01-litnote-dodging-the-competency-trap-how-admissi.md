# Analysis of "Dodging the Competency Trap? How Admissions and Financial Aid Offices Adapted to Test-Optional Policies After COVID-19"

## 📌 Core Research Question

How did higher education admissions and financial aid offices organizationally adapt their practices and routines in response to test-optional policies adopted during and after COVID-19? The paper draws on the concept of the "competency trap" — the tendency of organizations to cling to established routines even when environmental conditions change — to examine whether these offices genuinely transformed their evaluation processes or simply substituted one set of rigid practices for another.

## 🔬 Methodology

Based on the title's framing and its placement in the *Journal of Higher Education* (which frequently publishes qualitative and mixed-methods organizational studies), this paper most likely employs a **qualitative or mixed-methods case study design**. The probable approach includes:

- **Multi-site case studies** of admissions and financial aid offices at several institutions that adopted test-optional policies post-COVID
- **Semi-structured interviews** with admissions officers, financial aid administrators, and institutional leaders
- **Document/policy analysis** of institutional admissions criteria, merit aid formulas, and internal process guidelines before and after test-optional adoption
- **Organizational theory framework** — specifically drawing on the "competency trap" concept from organizational learning literature (Levitt & March, 1988) to analyze whether offices engaged in genuine adaptive learning or superficial procedural change

This is not a causal identification strategy (DiD, RD, IV, etc.) but rather an interpretivist/organizational analysis examining *how* and *why* adaptation occurred (or failed to occur) within institutional bureaucracies.

## 📊 Key Findings

Without access to the full text, the likely findings based on the title's framing ("Dodging the competency trap?") — with the question mark suggesting ambiguous results — include:

- Admissions offices likely showed **uneven adaptation**, with some genuinely developing holistic review processes while others simply shifted weight to other quantifiable metrics (GPA, course rigor) — effectively replicating the competency trap with different inputs
- Financial aid offices likely faced **particular difficulty adapting** merit aid formulas that were historically anchored to test scores, potentially creating misalignment between admissions decisions and aid packaging
- Institutional variation likely depended on factors such as selectivity level, resource capacity, staff training investments, and leadership commitment to holistic review
- The tension between organizational efficiency (standardized metrics) and equity goals (holistic, context-sensitive review) likely emerged as a central finding

## 💡 Relevance to My Research

This paper is highly relevant across all three of your research areas:

- **First-generation college students (FGCS):** Test-optional policies were widely framed as equity-enhancing for FGCS, who disproportionately lack access to test preparation. This paper likely reveals whether the *operational reality* within offices matched the *policy rhetoric* — critical for understanding whether FGCS actually benefit or whether new screening mechanisms reproduce existing advantages.

- **State financial aid policy:** If financial aid offices struggled to decouple merit aid from standardized test scores, this has direct implications for how state-level merit aid programs (e.g., HOPE/Zell Miller-type scholarships) may need to be redesigned. The organizational adaptation challenges documented here could inform your analysis of state aid policy implementation barriers.

- **Intergenerational educational mobility:** The competency trap framework offers a useful theoretical lens for your work — institutional routines that reproduce reliance on socioeconomically stratified metrics (whether test scores or their substitutes) function as mechanisms that constrain intergenerational mobility. This paper can help you articulate how organizational-level inertia translates into macro-level mobility patterns.

- **Methodologically**, if your own work is quantitative, this paper provides the qualitative "black box" explanation for mechanisms that your models might capture as treatment effects of policy changes.

## ⭐ Key Quote Worth Citing (verbatim from abstract)

Unfortunately, because the abstract provided contains only the volume/issue/page metadata ("Volume 97, Issue 1, null 2026, Page 148-172") and no substantive text, I **cannot provide a verbatim quote**. I recommend accessing the full abstract through the *Journal of Higher Education* (Vol. 97, No. 1, 2026, pp. 148–172) via your institutional library to extract a direct quotation — particularly any language around the competency trap concept as applied to admissions/aid adaptation, which would be highly citable in your own FGCS and state aid policy work.
