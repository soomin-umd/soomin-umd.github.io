## 📌 Core Research Question

Does a combined information provision and video role model intervention reduce socioeconomic inequalities in the transition from high school to university in Denmark, particularly by shifting expectations and enrollment behaviors among students from non-academic (i.e., first-generation) backgrounds?

## 🔬 Methodology

The study employs a **randomized controlled trial (RCT)** design, likely implemented at the classroom or school level within Danish high schools. The intervention has two bundled components:

1. **Information treatment** — providing students with concrete data (likely about returns to education, application processes, financial aid availability, or university life realities)
2. **Video role model treatment** — exposing students to narratives from relatable individuals (likely university students or graduates from similar socioeconomic backgrounds) via video testimonials

This "combined" design tests whether pairing statistical/factual information ("numbers") with personal testimonials ("narratives") can shift both beliefs and behaviors. The identification strategy rests on **random assignment** to treatment and control conditions, allowing causal interpretation of effects. Outcome measures appear to include (a) **expectations** about attending university (likely measured via post-intervention survey) and (b) **actual enrollment** in higher education (likely tracked through Danish administrative register data, which is a hallmark strength of Scandinavian education research). Heterogeneous treatment effects are almost certainly examined by **parental education level** (first-generation status) to assess whether the intervention narrows the socioeconomic gap.

## 📊 Key Findings

Based on the truncated abstract, the intervention produced:

- A **significant increase in expectations** of attending university — likely concentrated among students from non-academic/lower-SES households
- The abstract implies differential effects by family background, suggesting the intervention was **equity-enhancing** rather than uniformly boosting all students' expectations
- Specific effect sizes are not available from the truncated abstract, but given the journal's standards (EEPA), the study likely reports intention-to-treat (ITT) estimates with meaningful but modest effect sizes typical of light-touch informational interventions (likely in the range of 2–6 percentage points on enrollment or expectations)

## 💡 Relevance to My Research

This paper is **highly relevant** across all three of your research pillars:

- **Intergenerational educational mobility**: The study directly targets the mechanism by which parental education constrains children's postsecondary transitions. The role model component is designed to disrupt the intergenerational transmission of low educational expectations — a key channel in mobility research.
- **First-generation college students (FGCS)**: The intervention is explicitly designed to close the gap between first-generation and continuing-generation students. It provides evidence on whether information asymmetries and lack of relatable exemplars are binding constraints for FGCS — or whether structural barriers (financial, institutional) dominate.
- **State financial aid policy**: Denmark's context of tuition-free university education plus universal student grants (SU) provides a powerful **counterfactual setting**: even when financial barriers are essentially removed by policy, socioeconomic gaps in access persist. This suggests that informational and psychosocial barriers operate *independently* of financial constraints — a critical insight for your work on state financial aid, as it implies that **aid policy alone may be insufficient** without complementary informational interventions.

The Danish universal-aid context also allows you to argue that FGCS disparities in the U.S. reflect a *combination* of financial and informational/cultural barriers, strengthening the case for bundled policy approaches.

## ⭐ Key Quote Worth Citing (verbatim from abstract)

> "The intervention led to a significant increase in expectations of …"

*(Note: The abstract is truncated at this point in the provided text. I recommend retrieving the full abstract for the complete quote, which likely concludes with language about expectations of attending university and/or differential effects by parental education background. The title itself — **"Numbers and Narratives"** — is also highly citable as a framing device for the complementarity of information and role model interventions.)*
