# Analysis of "It Was a Good Day? Time Use and Subjective Well-Being Among Lower-Income College Students"

**Journal of Higher Education, 2026**

---

## 📌 Core Research Question

How do lower-income college students allocate their time across daily activities (e.g., studying, working, socializing, sleeping), and how does this time use relate to their subjective well-being? The study likely investigates whether the daily lived experiences of economically disadvantaged students differ meaningfully from their more affluent peers and whether specific time-use patterns are associated with higher or lower well-being — shedding light on the qualitative dimensions of the college experience beyond persistence and completion metrics.

## 🔬 Methodology

Without access to the full text (the abstract field is empty), the methodology can be inferred from the title's reference to **time use** and **subjective well-being**, which strongly suggests:

- **Experience Sampling Method (ESM) or Daily Diary / Day Reconstruction Method (DRM):** These are standard approaches for capturing how individuals spend their time and how they feel during or about those activities. Participants typically report activities and associated affect at multiple points throughout the day or reconstruct the previous day's activities.
- **Time-use surveys:** Possibly drawing on structured time diaries (e.g., American Time Use Survey–style instruments) adapted for college students.
- **Analytic strategy:** Likely employs **multilevel/hierarchical linear modeling (HLM)** to account for the nested structure of observations (time points within days within individuals). May also use **OLS or fixed-effects regression** to examine within-person variation in well-being as a function of activity type, controlling for individual-level characteristics (income, demographics, institutional context).
- **Sample:** Likely a purposive or stratified sample of lower-income college students (possibly defined by Pell Grant receipt, family income thresholds, or expected family contribution), potentially with a comparison group of higher-income peers.
- **Subjective well-being measures:** Could include momentary affect (positive/negative), life satisfaction scales, or domain-specific satisfaction (academic, social).

*Note: Specific identification strategy details are unavailable due to the empty abstract; the above is informed inference based on the methodological conventions of time-use and well-being research in higher education.*

## 📊 Key Findings

Specific effect sizes and numbers are unavailable given the blank abstract. However, based on the title and the existing literature in this space, anticipated key findings likely include:

- Lower-income students spend **more time in paid employment** and **less time in extracurricular/social activities** compared to higher-income peers, which may be negatively associated with well-being.
- Time spent in **academically meaningful activities** (studying, attending class) may have a positive but modest association with well-being, potentially moderated by financial stress.
- **Sleep deprivation and time scarcity** among lower-income students may emerge as significant predictors of reduced subjective well-being.
- The relationship between time use and well-being is likely **heterogeneous** — certain activities (e.g., socializing, leisure) may yield higher well-being returns, but lower-income students have less discretionary time to allocate to them.
- The study may reveal a **"time poverty"** dimension of inequality in higher education that mirrors financial poverty.

## 💡 Relevance to My Research

This paper is highly relevant across multiple dimensions of your research agenda:

- **First-Generation College Students (FGCS):** Lower-income students and FGCS populations overlap substantially. The daily lived experience — how students actually spend their hours — shapes sense of belonging, academic integration, and ultimately persistence. Time-use constraints (e.g., needing to work extensive hours) are a key mechanism through which FGCS experience college differently.
- **Intergenerational Educational Mobility:** If lower-income students' well-being is systematically undermined by time-use patterns shaped by economic necessity, this represents a qualitative barrier to upward mobility even among those who *do* access college. Completing a degree under chronic stress and time poverty may yield different long-term returns (labor market, health, civic participation) than completing one under more favorable conditions.
- **State Financial Aid Policy:** This study provides an implicit argument for the importance of **grant-based financial aid** (as opposed to loans or work-study). If paid work hours crowd out study time, sleep, and social integration — and these patterns reduce well-being — then state aid policies that reduce students' need to work (e.g., more generous need-based grants, emergency aid funds, living cost stipends) could improve both well-being and educational outcomes. This connects directly to policy evaluation questions in your research.

## ⭐ Key Quote Worth Citing

*Unfortunately, a verbatim quote cannot be provided as the abstract content was not included in the available metadata. I recommend accessing the full article through your institutional library or the Journal of Higher Education's online portal (likely available via Taylor & Francis) to extract a direct quotation for citation purposes.*

**Recommendation:** Given your research focus, this paper could be particularly valuable as a citation when arguing that financial aid policy affects not just access and completion but the *quality of the college experience* for disadvantaged students — a dimension often overlooked in mobility-focused quantitative work.
