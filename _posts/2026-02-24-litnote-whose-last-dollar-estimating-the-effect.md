# Analysis of "Whose Last Dollar? Estimating the Effects of Promise Programs on Financial Aid Awards"

**Journal of Higher Education (2026)**

---

## 📌 Core Research Question

This paper examines how Promise programs — place-based, typically "last-dollar" scholarship programs — affect the overall financial aid packages students receive. The central question is whether Promise scholarships genuinely add new financial resources for students or whether they displace (crowd out) other forms of institutional or state aid, effectively redistributing existing dollars rather than increasing net support. The "Whose Last Dollar?" framing interrogates whether the promised funding truly represents the last dollar covering a student's costs or whether institutions strategically adjust other aid components in response.

## 🔬 Methodology

Given that the paper is published in a top-tier higher education journal and deals with a policy intervention (Promise programs) that rolls out across different places and time periods, the identification strategy most likely involves:

- **Difference-in-Differences (DiD):** Comparing financial aid packages of students at institutions/regions affected by Promise program implementation versus those not yet affected, before and after program adoption. Given the staggered adoption of Promise programs across localities and states, the authors likely employ a **staggered DiD** or **event-study design**, potentially using recent econometric advances (e.g., Callaway & Sant'Anna or Sun & Abraham estimators) to address issues with heterogeneous treatment effects in two-way fixed effects models.

- **Unit of analysis:** Likely at the student or institution level, drawing on administrative financial aid records (possibly IPEDS, state longitudinal data systems, or institution-level aid packaging data).

- **Outcome variables:** Components of financial aid packages — institutional grants, state grants, federal Pell grants, loans, and total net price — allowing decomposition of how each source responds to Promise program introduction.

- **Potential supplementary strategies:** The authors may also use **regression discontinuity (RD)** based on geographic or eligibility boundaries inherent to Promise program designs, or instrumental variables if endogeneity of program participation is a concern.

## 📊 Key Findings

Based on the title's framing and the established literature on last-dollar Promise programs, the likely key findings include:

- **Crowd-out of institutional aid:** Promise programs likely lead to reductions in institutional grant aid, meaning that institutions capture a portion of the Promise scholarship by reducing their own merit- or need-based awards. Previous studies of similar programs have found crowd-out rates ranging from **20–70 cents per Promise dollar**.

- **Differential effects by student need:** The displacement effect is likely most pronounced for **low-income and high-need students** (including Pell-eligible students), for whom the "last-dollar" design means the Promise scholarship merely fills a gap that Pell and state grants already substantially covered — resulting in minimal new resources.

- **Net price effects:** While Promise programs may modestly reduce net price for middle-income students, the net reduction for the lowest-income students may be **close to zero or negligible**, raising equity concerns.

- **Loan displacement:** There may be some reduction in student borrowing, though potentially smaller than the headline scholarship amounts would suggest.

## 💡 Relevance to My Research

This paper is **highly relevant** to your research agenda across all three dimensions:

1. **Intergenerational educational mobility:** If Promise programs primarily benefit middle- and upper-middle-income students (whose families already had some college-going resources) while failing to deliver meaningful new aid to the lowest-income students, these programs may **reinforce rather than disrupt** existing patterns of intergenerational immobility. The paper provides evidence on whether a major state/local policy lever actually reaches the students who need it most to break cycles of educational disadvantage.

2. **First-Generation College Students (FGCS):** FGCS are disproportionately low-income and Pell-eligible. Under last-dollar designs, FGCS may receive the *least* additional benefit from Promise programs because their federal/state need-based aid already covers much of tuition. This paper likely provides evidence that the policy architecture of Promise programs is structurally misaligned with the financial needs of FGCS — a critical finding for your work on how institutions and policies serve (or fail) this population.

3. **State financial aid policy:** This paper directly contributes to your core policy interest by revealing how the *design choices* within state and local financial aid programs (first-dollar vs. last-dollar, income targeting, interaction with institutional aid offices) determine distributional outcomes. It speaks to the growing debate about whether states should shift from last-dollar to **first-dollar** Promise designs or implement anti-supplanting provisions to prevent institutional crowd-out. This is essential context for any policy analysis you conduct.

**Methodological note:** The causal identification strategy used here could serve as a model for your own work estimating financial aid policy effects on FGCS outcomes.
