# Analysis of "Who are the 'Scholars' in 'Scholarship?': How Higher Education Researchers Represent Positionality in Their Studies"

**Journal of Higher Education | 2026-03-01**

---

## 📌 Core Research Question

How do higher education researchers represent and disclose their own positionality (social identities, backgrounds, and standpoints) within their published scholarship, and what patterns, norms, and gaps exist in these practices across the field? The study likely interrogates who is doing the researching, how their backgrounds shape their inquiry, and whether reflexive positionality statements have become substantive methodological practice or performative convention.

## 🔬 Methodology

Given the title and focus, this is most likely a **systematic content analysis / meta-research study** of published higher education scholarship rather than a causal inference design. The methodology likely involves:

- **Systematic or scoping review** of a defined corpus of articles from major higher education journals (e.g., *Journal of Higher Education*, *Research in Higher Education*, *Review of Higher Education*) over a specified time period
- **Qualitative content analysis and/or coding framework** applied to positionality statements, researcher identity disclosures, and reflexivity practices
- Potentially a **mixed-methods approach** combining quantitative descriptive analysis (frequency, trends over time, journal differences) with qualitative thematic analysis of how positionality is framed
- **No causal identification strategy** (DiD, RD, IV, PSM) — this is a meta-analytical/methodological critique paper rather than an impact evaluation

## 📊 Key Findings

Without access to the full text (the abstract provided is blank), specific numbers and effect sizes cannot be confirmed. However, based on the title and the journal's scope, anticipated findings likely include:

- Positionality disclosures in higher education research have increased over time but remain uneven across methodological traditions (more common in qualitative work, rarer in quantitative studies)
- Researchers may disproportionately disclose certain identity dimensions (e.g., race, gender) while omitting others (e.g., class background, first-generation status, disability)
- Positionality statements may often be superficial or formulaic rather than analytically integrated into research design and interpretation
- Patterns may reveal whose voices and perspectives dominate higher education scholarship and whose remain invisible

## 💡 Relevance to My Research

This paper holds **significant methodological and conceptual relevance** for your work on intergenerational educational mobility, FGCS, and state financial aid policy:

- **Researcher positionality in FGCS research**: As someone studying first-generation college students, this paper likely raises critical questions about whether researchers studying FGCS are themselves first-generation — and how that shapes the framing of deficits vs. assets, the research questions asked, and the policy recommendations offered. If most FGCS researchers are continuing-generation scholars, this has implications for how the population is understood and represented.
- **Class and intergenerational mobility as under-disclosed identities**: The paper may reveal that socioeconomic background and generational educational status are among the least-disclosed positionality dimensions, even though they profoundly shape researchers' epistemological orientations — directly relevant to your focus on intergenerational mobility.
- **Reflexive practice in policy research**: If you employ qualitative or mixed methods in studying state financial aid policy, this paper provides a framework for thinking about how to meaningfully integrate your own positionality into your research design and writing.
- **Power and knowledge production**: Understanding who produces scholarship about educational inequality — and from what vantage point — is essential context for any literature review you conduct on FGCS or financial aid.

## ⭐ Key Quote Worth Citing

The abstract text provided is effectively blank (containing only `<br />`), so a verbatim quote cannot be extracted. I recommend retrieving the full abstract directly from the *Journal of Higher Education* once available for a citable passage. A quote addressing the gap between who researches and who is researched in higher education would be particularly powerful for framing your own positionality as a scholar of intergenerational mobility and FGCS.

**Note:** This analysis is based on the title, journal, and publication date, as the abstract content was not available. I recommend revisiting this analysis once the full text is accessible, as specific findings, coding frameworks, and disciplinary critiques would sharpen its utility for your dissertation work considerably.
