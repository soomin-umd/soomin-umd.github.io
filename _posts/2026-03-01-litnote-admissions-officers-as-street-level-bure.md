## 📌 Core Research Question

How do admissions officers at selective higher education institutions exercise discretion when implementing holistic admissions practices, and how do their competing conceptions of equity shape access decisions? The study frames admissions officers as **street-level bureaucrats** (drawing on Lipsky's classic framework), examining how individual-level discretion mediates institutional policy and produces varied—and sometimes contradictory—equity outcomes.

## 🔬 Methodology

This is a **qualitative study** based on **51 semi-structured interviews** with admissions personnel (likely at selective institutions adopting holistic review processes). There is no quantitative identification strategy (no DiD, RD, IV, PSM, etc.). The analytical framework is rooted in:

- **Street-level bureaucracy theory** (Lipsky, 1980/2010), which emphasizes how front-line workers use discretion to interpret and implement policy in ways that may diverge from official intent.
- Likely **thematic/interpretive analysis** of interview transcripts to surface how admissions officers conceptualize "equity" and how those conceptualizations translate into concrete decision-making practices.
- The comparative dimension appears to be **international**, given the abstract's reference to "selective higher education institutions around the world," suggesting cross-national or multi-institutional sampling.

**Strength of design**: Rich, process-oriented data on the "black box" of holistic admissions—a domain that is notoriously opaque and difficult to study quantitatively.

**Limitation**: Findings reflect reported practices and beliefs rather than observed decision outcomes; no causal claims about effects on enrollment composition.

## 📊 Key Findings

Given that the paper is listed as "Ahead of Print" with a truncated abstract, specific effect sizes or detailed findings are not available. Based on the framing, anticipated key findings likely include:

- Admissions officers hold **multiple, competing definitions of equity** (e.g., race-conscious diversity vs. socioeconomic inclusion vs. meritocratic fairness vs. geographic representation).
- **Discretion is exercised unevenly**: individual officers' backgrounds, values, and institutional pressures shape which equity conception prevails in particular cases.
- Holistic admissions, rather than producing a uniform equity outcome, creates **structured ambiguity** that can both expand and constrain access depending on how discretion is deployed.
- Institutional signals (rankings pressures, revenue needs, legal environments) create **competing logics** that officers must navigate, sometimes undermining equity-oriented goals.

## 💡 Relevance to My Research

This paper is highly relevant across several dimensions of your research agenda:

1. **Intergenerational educational mobility**: Selective college admissions is a critical gateway mechanism in the intergenerational transmission of advantage. If admissions officers' discretion systematically favors certain conceptions of equity over others (e.g., racial diversity over socioeconomic inclusion), this has direct implications for whether holistic admissions disrupts or reproduces class-based mobility patterns. This paper helps you theorize the **micro-level mechanisms** within institutions that mediate macro-level mobility patterns.

2. **First-generation college students (FGCS)**: FGCS status is one dimension that holistic review *could* foreground—but whether it does depends on how individual officers exercise discretion. This study likely reveals whether FGCS identity is treated as a salient equity category or is subordinated to other dimensions (race, geography, talent). This matters for your work on whether FGCS are legible to institutional gatekeepers.

3. **State financial aid policy**: The street-level bureaucracy framework is directly transferable to how financial aid officers and state agency personnel implement aid policy. If you study how state aid programs are administered (e.g., need-based vs. merit-based, eligibility determination), this paper offers a theoretical lens and methodological model for examining **discretion in policy implementation** beyond admissions.

4. **Methodological model**: If your dissertation includes qualitative or mixed-methods components, this study published in EEPA—a top-tier quantitative-leaning policy journal—demonstrates that rigorous qualitative work on institutional processes can reach elite outlets.

## ⭐ Key Quote Worth Citing (verbatim from abstract)

> "Selective higher education institutions around the world are increasingly adopting holistic admissions practices—making it crucial to understand how admissions personnel make decisions, with what consequences for access and equity."

*(Note: Only a partial abstract was available; this is the most complete verbatim passage extractable from the provided text. I recommend pulling additional quotes from the full text once accessible, particularly any language around competing equity logics and discretionary decision-making.)*
