## 📌 Core Research Question

How does classification as an English Learner (EL) function as a categorical label that restricts students' access to college-level coursework (e.g., AP, IB, dual enrollment) during high school, and how does this sorting mechanism subsequently shape postsecondary educational opportunity?

## 🔬 Methodology

The abstract is truncated, so full methodological details are not available. However, based on the framing—"categorical inequality" and "leveled tracking"—and the journal's methodological standards (*EEPA* prioritizes causal or quasi-causal designs), the study likely employs one or more of the following:

- **Regression discontinuity (RD)** or **fuzzy RD** around EL classification/reclassification thresholds (e.g., English proficiency assessment cutoff scores), comparing students just above and just below the threshold to isolate the effect of the EL *label* distinct from underlying English proficiency.
- **Instrumental variables (IV)** using reclassification timing or policy variation as an instrument for EL status duration.
- **Propensity score matching (PSM) or inverse probability weighting** comparing EL-classified students to observationally similar peers who were never classified or who were reclassified earlier.
- **Administrative longitudinal data** tracking cohorts from high school through postsecondary enrollment/completion, likely from a state longitudinal data system (SLDS).

The theoretical scaffolding draws on Tilly's **durable/categorical inequality** framework and Hasan's or Callahan's **leveled tracking** concept, arguing that EL status operates not merely as a linguistic support designation but as a de facto curricular track that limits access to rigorous coursework.

## 📊 Key Findings

Specific effect sizes are unavailable from the truncated abstract. Based on the framing and title, anticipated findings include:

- EL-classified students have **significantly lower rates of enrollment in college-level courses** (AP, IB, dual enrollment) compared to peers with similar academic profiles and English proficiency levels.
- The EL label operates as a **sorting mechanism independent of actual language ability**, channeling students away from college-preparatory pathways.
- Reduced access to college-level coursework in high school **mediates lower rates of postsecondary enrollment and/or enrollment in four-year institutions** for EL-designated students.
- Effects are likely concentrated among students near reclassification thresholds—those with sufficient proficiency to succeed in college-level courses but who remain administratively classified as EL.

## 💡 Relevance to My Research

This study connects to your research agenda in several important ways:

1. **Intergenerational educational mobility**: EL students are disproportionately children of immigrant parents with limited formal education in the U.S. context. The EL label functioning as a tracking mechanism represents a concrete institutional barrier to upward intergenerational mobility—where the parent generation's linguistic background (an inherited characteristic) constrains the child generation's access to college-preparatory curricula and, ultimately, postsecondary attainment.

2. **First-generation college students (FGCS)**: EL students are overwhelmingly likely to be potential FGCS. If the EL label systematically restricts access to AP/dual enrollment courses—which serve as key signals and preparation for college admission and financial aid—this represents a **pre-college pipeline constraint** that shapes who becomes an FGCS who enrolls versus one who never reaches postsecondary education at all. The study highlights how institutional sorting in K–12 predetermines FGCS outcomes before college access interventions can take effect.

3. **State financial aid policy**: Many state merit-based financial aid programs (e.g., Georgia HOPE, Florida Bright Futures, state dual enrollment subsidies) require or reward completion of college-level coursework in high school. If EL classification systematically excludes students from these courses, it creates a **compounding disadvantage**: EL students are denied both the academic preparation and the eligibility criteria for state financial aid. This is a critical equity consideration for your work on how state aid policy interacts with pre-existing structural inequalities.
