## 📌 Core Research Question

How effective have school finance reforms (SFRs) been at reducing racial/ethnic disparities in school funding, and why does school funding remain racially unequal even as it has become more economically progressive?

## 🔬 Methodology

Based on the abstract and the journal's methodological norms, this study likely employs a **difference-in-differences (DiD)** or **event-study** framework that exploits the staggered timing of court-ordered and legislative school finance reforms across states. The identification strategy would compare changes in per-pupil funding across districts with varying racial/ethnic compositions before and after SFR implementation, while controlling for economic progressivity. The study likely uses district-level fiscal data (e.g., from the Census of Governments/F-33 data) merged with demographic enrollment data over several decades. The key analytical contribution appears to be decomposing the economic vs. racial dimensions of funding equity—showing that reforms targeted at income-based progressivity do not automatically translate into racial equity, possibly because race and class are correlated but not perfectly overlapping, and because within-state geographic and political structures (district boundaries, local property tax bases shaped by residential segregation) mediate reform effects differently along racial lines.

## 📊 Key Findings

- School funding has become **more economically progressive** over time (i.e., lower-income districts have gained relative to higher-income districts).
- Despite this economic progressivity, **racial/ethnic funding disparities persist**—districts serving predominantly students of color remain underfunded relative to predominantly white districts.
- The progress of SFRs in closing racial funding gaps has been **slow**, suggesting these reforms are insufficient substitutes for desegregation efforts.
- *(Specific effect sizes are not available from the truncated abstract but likely appear in the full text.)*

## 💡 Relevance to My Research

This paper is highly relevant across all three of your research areas:

- **Intergenerational educational mobility**: Persistent racial funding disparities represent a structural mechanism through which educational disadvantage is transmitted across generations. If schools serving communities of color remain underfunded even after finance reforms, the "great equalizer" function of public schooling is undermined for precisely the populations with the lowest intergenerational mobility.
- **First-generation college students (FGCS)**: FGCS are disproportionately students of color from under-resourced K-12 systems. Inadequate school funding translates into fewer AP courses, weaker college counseling, and lower college-readiness—all barriers that produce first-generation status in the next generation. This paper helps you contextualize the **K-12 pipeline conditions** that shape FGCS experiences.
- **State financial aid policy**: The paper highlights a critical lesson for state-level policy design: **economically progressive reforms do not automatically achieve racial equity**. This finding has direct implications for state financial aid—need-based aid formulas that are class-conscious but race-neutral may similarly fail to close racial gaps in college access and completion. It provides a strong analogue and cautionary framework for evaluating whether state grant programs (e.g., those modeled on need-based criteria alone) adequately serve students of color.

## ⭐ Key Quote Worth Citing (verbatim from abstract)

> "School funding has become more economically progressive but remains unequal by race/ethnicity. As desegregation efforts decline, school finance reforms (SFRs) are increasingly important for addressing racial/ethnic funding disparities."
