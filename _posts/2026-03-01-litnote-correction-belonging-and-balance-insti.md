## 📌 Core Research Question

This paper examines how institutional factors, socioeconomic conditions, and external demands contribute to racial variation in time-to-degree among students who complete college. The core inquiry centers on whether belonging and balance—navigating institutional environments alongside competing life demands—differentially affect how long it takes students of different racial backgrounds to finish their degrees.

## 🔬 Methodology

**Note:** This entry is a **correction notice** (erratum/corrigendum) to a previously published article, not a standalone empirical study. Correction notices typically address errors in data, analysis, reporting, or authorship in the original publication. Without access to the full correction text or the original article's detailed methodology, the original study likely employed:

- Quantitative analysis of administrative or survey data on college completers
- Regression modeling examining time-to-degree as the dependent variable
- Decomposition or interaction analyses across racial/ethnic groups
- Covariates capturing institutional characteristics (belonging measures, campus climate), socioeconomic status, and external demands (work, family obligations, financial pressures)

The specific identification strategy (e.g., OLS with controls, multilevel modeling, or other approaches) would need to be confirmed from the original article.

## 📊 Key Findings

As a correction notice, the abstract provides no specific findings or effect sizes. The original article's findings would detail racial disparities in time-to-degree and the mediating/moderating roles of belonging, socioeconomic background, and external demands. The correction may have amended specific coefficient estimates, significance levels, or interpretive claims.

## 💡 Relevance to My Research

Despite being a correction, the underlying study is highly relevant:

- **Intergenerational educational mobility:** Time-to-degree is a critical but underexamined dimension of educational attainment. Longer time-to-degree increases costs and delays labor market entry, compounding disadvantages for students from lower-SES and first-generation backgrounds—directly shaping intergenerational mobility trajectories.
- **First-generation college students (FGCS):** FGCS are disproportionately represented among those facing the "external demands" the paper examines (work obligations, family responsibilities, financial constraints) and may experience weaker institutional belonging—both of which extend time-to-degree.
- **State financial aid policy:** Financial pressures are a key external demand affecting time-to-degree. The racial variation documented here likely intersects with differential access to state financial aid; policies that reduce financial burden (e.g., need-based grants, last-dollar scholarships) could narrow racial gaps in completion timelines.
- The paper's framework of **belonging and balance** offers a useful conceptual lens for understanding how state-level aid policies might buffer or fail to buffer FGCS and racially minoritized students from forces that delay degree completion.

## ⭐ Key Quote Worth Citing

*(No abstract text was provided for this correction notice, so no verbatim quote is available. I recommend locating the original article's abstract for citable language on racial variation in time-to-degree and the role of institutional belonging, socioeconomic factors, and external demands.)*

**Recommendation:** Track down the **original article** (published in *Research in Higher Education*) as well as the specific content of this correction to determine whether any findings or conclusions were materially altered. The original study's framework linking belonging, external demands, and racialized time-to-degree patterns could be a valuable citation in work connecting state financial aid policy to equitable completion outcomes for FGCS and students from disadvantaged intergenerational backgrounds.
