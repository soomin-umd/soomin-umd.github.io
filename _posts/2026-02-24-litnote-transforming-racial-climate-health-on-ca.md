## 📌 Core Research Question

How can campus racial climate assessments be transformed to incorporate **structural competency**—an understanding of and intervention in structural racism—particularly within the current legal context that increasingly mandates "race-neutrality" (post-*SFFA v. Harvard*)? The paper interrogates why traditional campus climate surveys and interventions fail to disrupt structural racism and examines what a structurally competent approach would look like for institutional policy and practice.

## 🔬 Methodology

Based on the abstract and the journal's scope (EEPA publishes both quantitative and qualitative policy analyses), this paper likely employs a **critical policy analysis / conceptual-legal framework** rather than a traditional causal identification strategy. Specifically:

- **Framework**: Structural competency (borrowed from critical health/medical scholarship) applied to higher education racial climate work.
- **Legal analysis**: Examination of the constraints imposed by race-neutral legal mandates (e.g., *Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard/UNC*, state-level anti-DEI legislation) on institutional climate interventions.
- **Institutional/policy case analysis**: Likely reviews existing campus climate assessment practices and critiques their limitations through a structural racism lens.
- **No traditional econometric identification strategy** (DiD, RD, IV, PSM) appears to be employed; this is a **normative and analytic policy paper** rather than an empirical impact evaluation.

## 📊 Key Findings

While specific effect sizes are unavailable from the truncated abstract, the central arguments appear to be:

- Traditional campus climate assessments, while well-intentioned, **lack critical interventions in structural racism** and therefore produce limited or superficial change.
- These assessments are vulnerable to being **"co-opted"** by institutions to signal commitment to equity without making substantive structural changes (performative compliance).
- The legal push toward "race-neutrality" further constrains institutions' ability—or willingness—to name and address racialized structures directly.
- The paper proposes **structural competency** as a necessary reorientation: institutions must understand how policies, resource allocation, and organizational structures (not just interpersonal interactions or individual attitudes) produce racialized harm.

## 💡 Relevance to My Research

- **First-generation college students (FGCS)**: FGCS, who are disproportionately students of color from lower-income backgrounds, are among the most affected by hostile or unsupportive racial climates. If campus climate interventions remain superficial, FGCS bear the costs through lower belonging, persistence, and completion—directly affecting intergenerational mobility outcomes.
- **Intergenerational educational mobility**: Structural racism in campus environments functions as a **hidden barrier** to degree attainment that perpetuates intergenerational inequality. This paper's framework could help you theorize how institutional-level factors mediate the relationship between parental education and student outcomes beyond financial access alone.
- **State financial aid policy**: The legal context of "race-neutrality" is highly relevant. As states restrict race-conscious practices (including potentially race-targeted financial aid or support programs), understanding how structural competency can inform **race-neutral-yet-equity-promoting** financial aid design becomes critical. This paper provides a conceptual vocabulary for analyzing how state policy constraints interact with institutional capacity to promote equity.

*(Note: The abstract is truncated. The full quote would be essential to capture—likely completing the sentence with something about maintaining the status quo or institutional optics. I recommend retrieving the full abstract for the complete citation.)*

A usable partial quote:
